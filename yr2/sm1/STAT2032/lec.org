 _Cash Flows_
Uncertainties:
- Time
- Frequency
- Severity

Assumptions: 
- Cash flows = certain
- Interest rate = certain
  
Value of cFs (Asset):
$\mbox{Value of Asset } (t) = Vt(cF_t,cF_{t+1},...,cF_{t+n})$


Types of interest rates:
1. effective interest rate
2. simple interest
3. compound interest
   
*Effective interest rate*: $r_{e} = \frac{s(u+1)-s(u)}{s(u)}$

*Simple interest rate*: $s(T)=s(0)(1+Ti)$

*Compound interest rate*: $s(T)=s(0)(1+T)^{T}$

*Accumulation Factor*: $A(t_1,t_2)=\frac{s(t_{2})}{s(t_{1})}$

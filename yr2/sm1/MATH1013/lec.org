Don't forgot to read Stewart 1.1-1.3 by Monday

  _Functions_
For this course, only using real numbers for inputs and outputs

To specify a function:
- a rule
- a set of possible inputs (known as the _domain_)
  
Domain notation:
- \real - real numbers
- (a,b) = {x \elem \real:a<x<b}
- [a,b] ={x \elem \real:a=<x=<b}
- N = {0,1,2,3,...}
- Z = {...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...}
- Q = { $\frac{a}{b}$: a,b are integers}
  
  _Examples of Functions_
f(x)=x^3 on [0,\infin)

f(x)=x+1 on N

f(x)=$\frac{1}{x^^{}2}$ on [-1,0)\cup(0,1]

   
_Maximal Domain of a Function_: the largest set of real numbers on which the function can be defined 

3 points to remember:
- Can't divide by zero
- Can't take the root of -ve numbers
- Can't log -ve numbers

_Range of a Function_: the set of all output values on the domain

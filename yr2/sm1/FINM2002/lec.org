   _Course Overview_
   

*Derivative*: an instrument whose value depends on the value of other, more basic underlying variables.
Examples are:
- forwards (Remember: less standardized, traded on an exchange)
- futures (Remember: the more standardized ones, traded on an exchange)
- options contracts

Derivatives can be used to:
- hedge risks
- speculate (take a view on the future direction of the market)
- lock in an abitrage profit
- change the nature of liability

Futures terminology:  
- *Open interest*: the toal number of contracts outsanding
- *Settlement Price*: the price just before hte final bell each day
- *Volume of trading*: the number of trades in 1 day
  
*Call = Buy*, *Put = Sell*

Types of options:
- *American*: exercisable whenever up to delivery date
- *European*: exercisable only on the expiry date

** _Forwards and Futures_

*** Consumption vs. Investment Assets

When considering forward and futures contracts, it is important to distinguish betweeen *investment assets* and *consumption assets*
- investment assests are assests held by significant numbers of pepole purely for investment purposes (e.g. stock, bonds, gold and silver)
- consumption assets are assets held primarily for consumption and not usually fro investment purposes (e.g. copper, oil, pork bellies??)
  
We can use *arbitrage arguments* to determine the forward and futures prices of an investment asset from its spot price and other observable market variables. We are /not/ able to do this for consumption assets

*** Short Selling

Also known as shorting, involves selling an asset that is not owned

- Not possible for all investment assets
- broker borrows the securites from another client and sells them in the market in the usual way
- at some stage you must buy the securities back so they can be replaced in the account of the client you originally borrowed them from
- must pay dividends and other benefits to the client you borrowed from.
- client can be no better off, i.e. if you borrow a physical asset, client must pay you for the storage costs of the gold
- investor benefits if prices fall, as they sell the asset for a higher price
  
Investor is required to maintain a margin account with the broker

In Australia, only a limited number of stocks are allowed to be short sold, called the ASX Approved Securities List

*** Measuring interest rates
page 84 of textbook will help, also stuff from STAT2032

*** Assumptions
Assumptions regarding market participants:
1. no transaction costs when trading
2. subject to same tax rate on all net trading profits
3. can borrow money at the same risk-free rate of interst as they can lend money
4. take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as they occur
   
*** Forward and Futures Contract Prices
Remember that forward and futures contracts can be valued by recognizing that, in many cases, forward and futures markets are redundant. This occurs when the payoff from a forward or futures contract can be replicated by a position in:
1. the underlying asset, and
2. riskless bonds
   

   _**Arbitrage relationship between spot and forward contracts**_
| Position                       | Initial Cash flow | Terminal Cash Flow |
|--------------------------------+-------------------+--------------------|
| borrow and incur cost of carry | S_0               | -S_{0}e^{rT}         |
| buy one unit of commodity      | -S_0              | S_T                |
| enter 6-month forward sale     | 0                 | F-S_t              |
| Net portfolio value            | 0                 | F-S_{0}e^{rT}        |
# weird how org doesn't handle that table too well, wonder why?

In general, if $F_{0}>S_{0}e^{rT}$, arbitrageurs can make a riskless profit from buying the asset and entering into a short forward contract on the asset. \\

If $F_{0}>S_{0}e^{rT}$ arbitrageurs can make a riskless profit by shorting the asset and entering into a long forward contract. 

*** Forward and Futures contract Prices on Assets with Known Income
$$F_{0}=(S_{0}-D)e^{rT}$$

*** Forward and Futures Contract Prices on Stock Indices
$$F_{0}=S_{0}e^{(r-d)T}$$

/For stock indices in Australia, the convention is $25 per point/

**/Amount = base, Yield/Percentage = superscript/**

*** Futures and Forwards on Currencies
The underlying asset in a forward or futures currency contract is a certain number of units of a foreign currency. A foreign currency is analogous to a security providing a dividend yield. Holder of the currency can earn interest at the risk-free interest rate prevailing in the foreign country. E.g. the holder can invest the foreign currency in a foreign-denominated bond
\therefore continuous dividend yield = foreign risk-free interest rate

$$F_{0}=S_{0}e^{(r-r_{f})T}$$

*** Futures and Forwards on Commodities
In the absence of storage costs and income the forward price of a commodity that is an investment asset is given by:
$$F_{0}=(S_{0}-D)e^{rT}$$

If there are storage costs, $Q$ is the present value of all of the storage costs less all income during the life of the forward contract, and the forward price is given by:
$$F_{0}=(S_{0}_{}_{}+Q)e^{rT}$$

If storage costs and income are given as a percentage, then $q$ is the percentage storage costs less the percentage income during the life of the forward contract, and the forward price is given by:
$$F_{0}=S_{0}e^{(r-q)T}$$
 
**** Consumption Commodities
- Commodities that are consumption assets rather than investment assets usually provide no income, but can be subject to significant storage costs.
- Individuals and companies who keep such a commodity in inventory do so because of its consumption value, not because of its value as in investment. As a result:
  - Due to the high storage costs of consumption commodities, $Q$ is the present value of all of the storage costs, and the forward prices is given by: $$F_{0}\le(S_{0}+Q)e^{rT}$$
  - If storage costs are expressed as a proportion $q$ of the spot price, the equivalent formula is: $$F_{0}\le S_{0}e^{(r-q)T}$$ 

*** Valuing Forward Contracts
The value of a forward contract at the time it is first entered into is zero. At a later stage it may prove to have a positive or negative value. Suppose that:
- $K$ is delivery price in forward contract
- $F$ is the current forward price for the contract that was negotiated some time ago
- The delivery date is $T$ years from today
- $r$ is the $T$-year risk-free interest rate
- $f$ is the value of the forward contract today

The value of a long forward contract (on both types of consumption assets) is: $$f=(F-K)e^{-rT}$$

Similarly, the value of a short forward contract is: $$f=(K-F)e^{-rT}$$

*** Forward vs Futures Prices
Forwards and futures prices are usually assumed to be the same. When interest rates are uncertain, they are, in theory, slightly different:
- A string positive correlation between interest rates and the asset price implies the futures price is slightly higher than the forward price.
  - due to the person in the long position in a futures contract receiving an immediate gain because of daily settlement
  - the positive correlation indicates that interest rates are also likely to have risen, therefore the gain will be invested at a higher than average interest rate
- A strong negative correlation implies the reverse

*** Delivery
In a futures contract, the party in the short position has the right to choose to deliver the asset at any time during a certain period (called the delivery period)

The person in the short position has to give at least a few day notice of their intention to deliver

*** Hedging Strategies Using Futures
    
A *short hedge* is a hedge which involves a short position in futures contracts.
- Appropriate when the hedger already owns an asset and expects to sell it at some time in the future

A *long hedge* involves taking a long position in futures contracts.
- Appropriate when a company knows it will have to purchase a certain asset in the future and wants to lock in the price now

Arguments in favour of hedging include:
- Companies should focus on the main business they are in and take steps to minimize risks arising from interest rates, exchange rates, and other market variables
- By hedging, they avoid adverse movements such as sharp rises in the price of a commodity

Arguments against hedging include:
- Shareholders are usually well diversified and can make their own hedging decisions
- It may increase risk to hedge when competitors do not
- Explaining a situation where there is a loss on the hedge and a gain on the underlying can be difficult

*** Basis Risk
Hedges are not always perfect and straightforward. Some of the reasons for this are:
- The asset whose price is to be hedged may not be exactly the same as the asset underlying the futures contract
- The hedger may not be certain of the exact date the asset will be bought or sold
- The hedge may require the futures contract to be closed out before its delivery month

What is basis risk:
- If the asset to be hedged and the asset underlying the futures contract are the same, the basis risk should be zero at the expiration of the futures contract
- Prior to expiration, the basis may be positive or negative
- When the spot price increases by more than the futures price, the basis increases. We call this strengthening of the basis.
- When the futures price increases by more than the spot price, the basis declines. We call this weakening of the basis

*Basis = Spot price of asset to hedged - Futures price of contract used*
  
Basis risk with a long hedge:
- Suppose that:
  - $F_{1}$: Initial Futures Price
  - $F_{2}_{}$: Final Futures Price
  - $F_{3}_{}$: Final Asset Price
- You hedge the future purchase o an asset by entering into a long futures contract
- Cost of Asset = $S_{2}-(F_{2}-F_{1})=F_{1}+\mbox{ Basis}$ \\


Basis risk with a short hedge:
- Suppose that:
  - $F_{1}$: Initial Futures Price
  - $F_{2}_{}$: Final Futures Price
  - $F_{3}_{}$: Final Asset Price
- You hedge the future sale of an asset by entering into a short futures contract
- Price Realised = $S_{2}+(F_{1}-F_{2})=F_{1}+\mbox{ Basis}$

One key factor affecting basis risk is the choice of the futures contract to bu used for hedging. 
- Choose a deliver month that is as close as possible to, but later than, the end of the life of the hedge
- When there is no futures contract on the asset being hedged, choose the contract whose futures price is most highly correlated with the asset price

*** Cross Hedging

Occurs when the asset underlying the futures contract is different to the asset whose price is being hedged

*** Optimal Hedge Ratio

Hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the position taken in futures contracts to the size of the exposure

$$h=\rho\frac{\sigma_{S}_{}}{\sigma_{F}}$$

Where:
- \sigma_s is the standard deviation of $\delta S$, the change in the spot price during the hedging period
- \sigma_F is the standard deviation of $\delta F$, the change in the futures price during the hedging period
- \rho is the coefficient of correlation between $\delta S$ and $\delta F$

*** Hedging using Index Futures
    
$$ \beta\frac{P}{A}$$

- $P$ is the value of the portfolio
- $\beta$ is its beta
- $A$ is the value of the assets underlying one futures contract
  
Reasons for using index futures to hedge:
- Desire to be out of the market for a short period of time
- Desire to hedge systematic risk

** Innterest Rate Contracts & Swaps
*** Types of Interest Rates
*Treasury Rates*:
- The rate that an investor earns on Treasury bills and bonds
- these bills and bonds are risk-free

*London InterBank Offered Rate*:
- rate of interest the bank is prepared to make a large wholesale deposit with other banks

*Repo Rates*:
- repurchase agreement where an investment dealer sells securities they own and buys them back later at a slightly higher price

*** Bond Pricing
*Zero Rates*:
- the n-year zero-coupon rate is the rate of interest earned on an investment that starts today and lasts for n years
- All of the interest and principal is realised at the end of the n years, and as suck there are no intermediate or coupon payments

Most bonds that we can invest in provide a periodic cash flow called a coupon, with the bond's principal (or face value) received at the maturity of the bondThe therosetical price of the bond is the present value of all of the cash floaw reveived by the purchaser of the bond.

*Par yield*:
- the par yield for a certian bond is the coupon rate that causes the bond price to equal its par value (or face value)

**** Determining Treasury Rates

We can caluvulate Treasury rates form the quoted prices of the Treasury bonds

*** Forward Rates

An _forward rate_ is an interest rate which is fixed for a future transaction.  t

*** Iterest Rate Swaps

An agreement where a floating rate is exchanged for a fixed rate or vice versa

These can have a number of benefits attached to them:
- They can change your exposure from floating to fixed or fixed to floating
- They are able to reduce the costs of borrowing

there's a super long example for this so make sure that you understand it

/tenor = rate of coupon payments/

*** Valuation of an Interest Rate Swap

When a swap is entered into it has a value of 0. However, as time proceeds, the swap may obtain a positive or a negative value

Characteristics of variables:
- level of measurement
- nominal - named categories
- ordinal - ordered categories
- interval
- ratio

Nominal and ordinal are discrete, ratios are continuous, and intervals use interval measurement
# You know what these are, you don't need to go through those again

*** Notation
Population: 
- random variables: X, Y, Y_1, Y_2, X_2
- paramters: \mu, \epsilon, \pi

Sample (observations/measurements):
- sample instances of random variables: x, y, y_1, x_1 

FOR THE EXAMPLE IN THE LECTURE

Data: (x_i,y_i) | i=1,2,3,...,n n=138

sample mean of y = $\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}+...+y_{n}}{n}$, or in more compact form:  $y\bar = \frac{\sum^{n}^{}_{}_{i=1}y_{i}}{n}$


sample variance of y: \Delta^{2}y or s^{2}y = $\frac{S_{y}_{y}}{n-1}$ | n-1 = degrees of freedom = $$\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{{i=1}}^{n}(y_{i}-\bar{\mbox{y}})^{2}$$

unbiased point estimate of \delta^{2}y (population variance)

/we could do the same for x/

*** Central Limit Theorem
If we are sampling from a population with mean \mu y, and variance \delta^{2}y, then as n -> \infin the sampling distribution of the mean will approach: 
$$ N(y\mu,\frac{\delta^{2}^{}y}{n})$$

standard deviation of the sampling distribution is $\frac{y\delta}{\sqrt{n}}$

   _Confidence Intervals_

A 100(1-\alpha)% CI for y\mu in:
$\bar{\mbox{y}} \plusmn Z_{{\alpha/2}} . \frac{y\delta}{\sqrt{n}}$

1. point estimate
2. critical value from a standard distribution (model)
3. standard error

2 & 3 are the margin of error

But, in practise, we don't (usually) know \delta\mbox{y}! We estimate \delta\mbox{y} using \Delta\mbox{y} (the sample standard deviation)

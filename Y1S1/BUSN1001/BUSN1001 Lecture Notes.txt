## L1

Do the examples while reading
Read both ch. 1 and 2
Grab learning objectives from the slide to make sure that you understand all of it, also to be helpful
Go through **ALL** classes and take out definitions into a separate glossary
**Three financial reports**:
- Balance sheet
- Income statement
- Statement of cash flow

Be sure to look for “scales” e.g. A$M somewhere
Net assets = assets - liabilities
Grab proper definitions from chapter 1 for assets, liabilites, etc., then come up with easier to remember ones
Equity = Assets - Liabilities, “Net Assets”


## L2

fin ch 1 and get 2 from somewhere
Quiz next week ch 1 and 2
Total Assets = Total Liabilities and Equity

Be sure that balance sheets balance in each row if using a worksheet. But don’t add lines together it would seem, add up at end.
30000 = 30000
-28000 + 28000 = 0
+5000 = B(5000)
-4000 + 4000 = 0
-1000 = B(-1000)
= 2000 + 4000 + 28000 = 4000 + 3000
= 34000 = 34000 (tick!)
Curren Assets: (in order of being turned into cash)

Revenue from point of sale
Expenses when (defs on p 57,58,185), more advanced defs in chapter 6 and 13
	|Accruals |	Deferrals|
	|--|--|-:|
Revenues Acc. rev (asset) Unearned rev (liability)
Expenses Acc. exp (lia) 


eatch expenses into the same period as 
Match expenses into the same period as 
prepayment acc for cash inflow prior to rev and exp, Dr Prepaid, Cr Cash -> Dr Expense, Cr Prepaid

Work performed but not yet paid = Dr Wages Wxpense, Cr Accrued Wages
Payment made = Dr Accrued Wages, Cr Cash

Cash received in advance: Dr Cash, Cr Unearned Revenue (<- liability)
Performed = Dr Unearned Revenue, Cr Fees 

**Allowance for doubtful debts**
1. *Creating*

Concepts of profitability efficiency, liquidity, leverage
**NO TUTORIALS IN WEEK 7**
Melville Hall for this, econ and finance
Reading ch 6.1 to 6.3 helps with content in chapters 1 to 5, also ch 15, but no test of calculating ratios, apparently only 1 to 2 multiple choice questions, for ch 15.
**USE STUDY GUIDE, Look at that!** **Practice Exam on wattle, ave a crack at that lad**
Whack your student number and name on answer card, dark pencil for this as well. Perhaps pick up one especially when shopping next.
One statement for part B, income or balance sheet. Journal entries, post to pledger accounts (T or worksheet), and a correct financial report
Part C, short answer. Only 10 marks, so don't spend too much time on this one.
No questions during the exam. Mark in any assumptions needed on the answer book, for e.g. ambiguous stuff.

## L8

**Indirect method cash flow, Managing Cash and Internal Controls, Accounting for and Managing Inventory**

Techniques to manage shit

Chapters for M1 and M2 on Wattle
+CLICAD = Add on, Current Liabilities increases, Current Assets decreases.
Don't examine 7.5 petty cash, 7.6 annual report disclosures
Credit on bank statement = +ve, i.e. deposit/positive balance

## L9

**Catching up on working capital**
**Starting on Managerial Accounting**

Exam (possibly) on Thursday 9/6/16, 9 am, 3 hours

read chapters 10 (non-current assets) and chapter 12 (completing the balance sheet). 

Inv control
Two systems: perpetual, periodic
Two cost flow assumptions: FIFO, weighted average (not LIFO)
Valuation: Lower of cost or Net Realisable Value
Perpetual: update for every purchase and sale
Periodic: count inventory at end of period. COGS = beginning + purchases - ending

Periodic: weighted average: total cost of goods available for sale for a period / total number units available for sale for a period

NRV (market value) < cost because of:
- obsolescence
- lack of demand, falling prices
- uncompetitive production costs
- damage, product size or colour
rule applied at item/product level (not total inventory)

Levels of control follows "ABC" system
Categ. A: high levels of control, high-value, low-volume items
Categ. B: lower levels of recording wold apply to lesser-value, higher-volume items
Categ. C: lowest levels of control and recording would apply to low-value, high-volume items

Just In Time approach
- Zero inventory *if possible*
- Just In Time, order only when needed
- Minimize inventory holding costs
- Work with suppliers
- **But** consider out-of-stock costs

Accounts receivable (not examined), Which customers should receive credit?
5 C's of credit
Capital
Capacity
Collateral
Conditions
Character

Pay within terms, but not early, not late ( for managing accounts payable)
Policy on when to take discounts for early payment

The Cash cycle is 
The time from the payment of goods purchased for manufacture or resale to receipt of cash for final product or resale
Improves with faster collection of recivables, faster inventory turnover, slower payment of payables
For next: managerial accounting

## L10

Target Profit = (Fixed Costs + profit) / Cost Margin

**Full Product Costs**
Need information about costs:
- to control costs
- to aid planning
- to value inventories
- to aid in setting selling prices
- to ascertain the relative profitability of products

**Full costing** is concerned with all costs involved with achieving some objectives
**Full cost** is total amount of resources, usually measured in monetary terms, sacrificed to achieve a particular objective

For full cost in a single service/product firm, add all of the cost of production and divide by the number of units produced
For multi product/service operation, costs are split into two categories:
1. direct costs
2. indirect costs
**Direct Cost**: a cost that can be traced easily and accurately to a cost object, e.g. the  cost of tyres for a car
A **cost object** is an object for which costs are measured and assigned, like:
- a product
- a customer
- a department
- a project
- an activity, e.g. setting up equipment

**Indirect Cost**: a cost that cannod be traceed easily and accurately to a cost object, or is not economically feasible to do so, e.g. factory heating and lighting cost to a multi-product firm
The full cost of a cost object is the fum of direct cost and a fair share of indirect costs

Direct and indirect different to fixed and variable costs

**Absorption costing system**
Absorption rate = total overheads / level of activity
Overhead rate = costs/ allocation base
STAY AWAKE JUSTIN PLEASE NO FALLING RSLEPP

**Activity Based Costing**


## L12

**Capital Investment Decisions**
PV = FV/(1+r)^n
exam details next lecture, two practice exams on wattle so have a gander at those sooner rather than later because that would be bad going in with abosolutely now
do the surveys

Four methods to use:
1. accounting rate of return
2. payback period
3. net present value
4. internal rate of return

**Accounting rate of return** = Average Net Profit After Tax / Average Investment
**Average Investment** = (intial + residual)/2

**Payback Period** = Initial Cash Outlays / Annual Net Cash Flows 

## L13

Important: income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements
Key terms: assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses, income, profit
GAAP, IFR, AASB
accrual accounting, cash accounting
accounting for: timing differences between revenue and cash receipt, expenses and cash payments, sales and bad debts
Financial statemnt analysis not directly examinable, no assessment of ratios
statement of cash flows in multiple choice questions, definitely direct method, possibly indirect method
know the concept of activity based costing
capital investment decisions
don't need to calculate internal raeo of return on exam
bring student card, hb pencil, ruler, eraser, calc, brain (optional)

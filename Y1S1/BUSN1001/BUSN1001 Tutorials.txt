1. Woolworths is in the retail industry. They generate profits mostly by acting as a market to enable the selling of produce from other companies on to consumers, with the actual profit coming from the markup of the price of the products.
2. Revenues, cost of sales, profit of continuing operations (main because they provide the largest numbers).
3. Main for balance sheet are assets, liabilities and equity.
4. Operating activities, financing activities and some other activity that i didnâ€™t catch. Just the big headings, really.

1. 24,205.2 ($m)
2. 7558 ($m)

3. Faithful representation ensures that financial statements are not misleading intentionally, are not biased in any way, and are kept objective. 

Company Name, Title, and Date very important to put on the balance sheet.

quiz next week
Relevance is the other qualitative thingy majig - so faithful representation and relevance
Deferred income = liability
Categories that shit can currently be: Asset, liability, expense, equity
Expense and revenue closed off at the end of each period, so fresh at the open of each period
This period's opening balance = last period's closing balance
Helps to nest with double entry system, i.e. nest credits under debits, to make sure that they match
Debit entry comes first **ALWAYS**
profit = rev - exp
 Assets and liabilities NOT in inc stat
 Rev and Exp not in balance sheet


## T4

## T6 (week 8)

1. They consider they five steps for preparation to be:
- Learning about the enterprise and it's plans.
- Obtaining a clear understanding of the decision or evaluation to which the analysis will contribute
- Calculating the ratios, trends and other figures that apply to the specific problem
- Finding whatever comparative information available to provide a fram of reference for youour analysis.
- Focus on the analytical results that are most signifiant tho the decision-maker's circumstances, and integrate and organise the analysis so that it will be of most help to the decision-maker

2. Divisions:
- Coles
- Home Improvement and Office Supplies
- Department store retailing
- Industrial
- Insurance
Woolworths deals also in retail (Big W) and groceries, as well as (at least then) hardware. and home improvement. Woolworths however deal in hotels, which Coles does not.
Woolworths also operates in New Zealand.

General tips for quiz 3:
Draw on lots of evidence, e.g. things form annual report, comments form analysts, other media/news sources
Properly cite sources, avoid quoting directly
Use business English (no abreviations, e.g. don't, won't)
stuff from topic 6 is apparently helpful

##T7
1. a
2. a?
3. To seem smartererererereerer, calculate perecentage changes. It looks better, anddemonstrates that you actually sort of know what you're doing.
e.g. "Cash flows from omperation is positive in both years but it has decreased substantially from $1417m in '13 to 1069m in 2014 (24% change). Cash flows from investing activities have seen a small positive change. Sustantial chanege in cash from financing activities, which has changed from negative to positive, which is a very favourable outcome.
9.osmething. Negative for operating, more than last year. they're in the shit tbh. No income tax at all, everything else has increased, Shit just went out the window for them, which was nay good for business laddie. Expanded too quickly, did a Roman empire. 

practise doing all forms of statements this weekend, because you're shit at them
T accounts useful for cash flows, so get practising these nigger
Can take dividends straight from income statement, as there is no opening balance

## T8
1. Cash control: locked registers, proper accounting, person verification (i.e. signatures on checks), frequent cash deposits, segregation of duties, cheques should be endorsed with a stamp to prevent fraud
b. Inventory control: security, check records against current stock, lock warehouse, only acessible to people responsisible for handling inventory, segregation of duties again
c. Accounts Reveivable: subsidary ledgers for each debtor, different person in control of this than the one in control of the main control account, be on top of payments, make sure that your accounts receivable are paid on time.

7.19: don't know how to do this shit

7. b



10.6 This can result in increased profits because these suppliers aren't providing what they are paid for. They are maintaining more inventory than they would should for the same price. This could perhaps be prevented by increased security and more rigorous checking. Cameras, guards, physical inspections, xrays.

10.7 Could lock down shit when he arrives, view recent arrivals, subtract those from total inventory. It works by boosting the inventory of all the stores using only the inventory of one place. Multiple things actually is only one.

Bank reconciliation: reconciling between bank statement and company record of cash at bank (ideally)
Can differ because of:
1. Time differences, records appearsing on company record but not on bank statement.
2. Error, usually from the accountant at the company

Template for BR on TB pg. 291
Credits and debits are the reverse for each, i.e. Bank statement Dr. = Company's Cr.

## T10
1. Wrote off $250m, probably because the company couldn't pay. From Tessa: When yuo think they may have difficulty in meeting the obligation, like making provision for doubtful debts. So not writing off, but being careful with shit?
2a. expected profit is approx $620k
2b. It's 620k + the offer, not minus
for the question that i couldn't do:
For plan A, there is no obligation to pay back. The additional profit abialiable to exiting ordinary shareholders is higher. Less risky, as don't have to pay back.
For plan B, advantages: interest expense is tax deductibleand profit(?). Still not bad for existing shareholders, but not as good as issuing shares. Disadvantages: no dilution of existing ordinary shareholders' ownership interest.
2c. Nah m8, that's a huge chunk of profit gone. 
2d. If declining the offer will have a some problems, 
3a. profit of $476k
3b. profit of $524k
4. Should be subcontracted, as it brings down the total cost of production
For 3b, if the school allocates fixer overhead cost to each of their product lines (but their overheads wouldn't change), bagpipes make a pisitive contribution to profit of 46,000. (Contribution margin = Sales price - variable cost. Even though there is still a loss, the contribution margin itself is still positive, so it is better to leave the bagpipes running.

## T11

1a. Breakeven point is when the firm is neither making a profit or a loss, they are only covering their expenses
 b. They can always aim to operate above this point? Helps with planning activity level of the company. "Determine activity level required to tcover all costs associated with the product, business, etc. Assess activity required to achieve profit targets beyond the braeak even point. Assess margin of safety, which provides an indication of risk involved. 
 c. The breakeven point should increase, as lower prices lowers the contribution per unit, and this increases the number units of that must be sold to reach this point.

2a. i think it's around 34091
 b. $375000
 c. idk what this. **Contribution = Sales - variable costs**
 d. 2272 extra units?

3. idk 
4. d
5. c

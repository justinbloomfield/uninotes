stuff from topic 6 is apparently helpful

e.g. "Cash flows from omperation is positive in both years but it has decreased substantially from $1417m in '13 to 1069m in 2014 (24% change). Cash flows from investing activities have seen a small positive change. Sustantial chanege in cash from financing activities, which has changed from negative to positive, which is a very favourable outcome.
9.osmething. Negative for operating, more than last year. they're in the shit tbh. No income tax at all, everything else has increased, Shit just went out the window for them, which was nay good for business laddie. Expanded too quickly, did a Roman empire.

T accounts useful for cash flows, so get practising these nigger

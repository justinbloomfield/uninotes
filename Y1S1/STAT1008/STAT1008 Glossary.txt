# STAT1008 Glossary
**Statistical Inference**: The problem of determining the behaviour of a large population by studying a small sample from that population, i.e. making an estimate based on a sample.
**Population**: A collection of the whole of something.
**Sample**: A set of individuals drawn from a population.
**Parameters**: True values for things like the centre and spread of the population.
**Statistics**: Values that estimate the parameters, need to use *inference* to do this estimation.
**Census**: a study of all the elements of a population
###### Errors
**Sampling Error**: The differences that exist betwwen a population and a sample as a result of the sample selection. Will be reduced by a larger sample.
**Non Sampling Error**: Larger samples won’t reduce nonsampling error so more serious - includes coverage errors, nonresponse error and measurement error.
**Coverage Error**: Results from selection bias, reduced by having an adequate **sampling frame**
**Nonresponse Error**: Research shows that people in upper and lower economic classes respond less frequently to surveys than those in middle class. Results in nonresponse bias - cannot assume that who respond are the same as those who don’t. Non-responses need to be followed up.
###### Measurement Errors
**Ambiguous Wording**: Questions must be clear
**Hawthorne Effect**: Respondent feels obligated to please the interviewer. Interviewers must be trained well to minimise this effect, and both they and the questions must be neutral, not leading.
**Respondent Error**: Minimised by screening responses and following up unusual answers, and establishing a program of re-contacing people to fillow up answers.

**Sample Frame**: List of all items that make up the population, choice of this is important. Sample is then chosen from the sample frame.
**Nonprobability or Probability Sampling**: *Nonprobability* chooses the items to be included without knowing the probabilities of selection; statistical inference can not be used with this data. *Probability* selects items based on known probabilities, **can** use stat inference.
**Convenience Sampling**: Using clients available to us as a sample.
**Judgemental Sampling**: Involves selection of experts in some areas. However, experts are often inaccurate.
**Quota Sampling**: Select people nonrandomly according to some fixed quota. Two categories: proportional or non-proportional quota sampling. For example, if you know there are 60% men and 40% women in a population, then out of 100 60 men and 40 women would be chosen. Non-proportional is less restrictive, as the minimum number of units is specified for each category.
**Snowball Sampling**: Begin by identifying someone who meets the criteria in your study, and then ask him/her to refer to others who they think also satisfy these selection criteria. One disadvantage is that you can’t assess the sampling quality.
**Simple Random Sampling**: Simplest probabilistic sampling, it is reasonable to generalize the results from the sample of the population. Aims to select n units out of N (total units in population) such that each element of your sample has an equal chance of being selected. One disadvantage is that you do not get a good representation of subgroups in a population due to chance.
**Systematic Random Sampling**: 
1. Number the units in the population from 1 to N
2. Decide the n (sample size) we want or need
3. k = N/n = interval size
4. Randomly draw an integer between 1 and n (?), e.g. if k = 4, sample units 4, 14, 24, 34, etc.

**Stratified Random Sampling**: Sometimes called proportional or quota random sampling, involving dividing our population into homgeneous subgrougs and then taking a simpe random smaple in each subgroup. Sex, Religion and Race are categories for identifying subgroups.
**Cluster/Area Random Sampling**: Divide population into clusters, randomly sample these clusters, measure **all** units within sampled clusters.

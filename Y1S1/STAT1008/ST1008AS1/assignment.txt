# STAT1008 ASSIGNMENT 1

1. a. 
	**Rows**: Each row corresponds to the 'overall day number', with the other data in the row being the measurements of the other categories on that particular day.
	**X**: This column refers to the day the data was recorded for that row, and is of the type 'count'. This is because the days are counted as a whole, increasing *only* by 1 each time.  A half-day or some other such way of measuring it is not possible under this method of measurement, making it a 'count' type. 
	**Ozone**: This column contains the data for the Ozone density, in whatever unit this is measured in. As the data contains no decimal data, it is assumed to be 'count' data as well, as if it were not the recordings would not be whole integers. The data could be continuous and have been rounded, but this is not specified and thus it is safer to assume it as count rather than continuous.
	**Solar.R**: Contains data for the Solar Radiation on the particular day. Again, all of the entries are integers, so 'count' is assumed. However, due to the volatility of radiation, common sense would indicate that this data should be continuous. Nevertheless, no decimals are seen, and it is safer to assume 'count'.
	**Wind**: The data for the wind speed in miles per hour. There are an infinite number of speeds wind can travel at, and speed must be measured rather than counted, so the data is of type 'continuous'.  
	**Temp**: The temperature measured in Fahrenheit.

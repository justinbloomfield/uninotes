### ASESSMENTS
- Tutorial quizzes 15%
- mid-sem exam (25% or 0%, discussed later on in term) - material from lectures 1 to 5. If you fuck this up, it doesn’t count.
- final (60% or 85% depending on what happens with the mid-sem). Covers whole course, but focuses on later half.
Tutorial sign-ups avialable ten minutes after *this* lecture (Wednesday 3pm ideal)
**No workshop this week!** (so we’re both free on friday this week!)
Extra practice questions available on WATTLE for self study
**Calculator**: (tests closed book, no cheat sheet) should be fine
One week difference between tutorial and lecture
Past exams and answers available on course page on WATTLE
“Dollar today worth more than a dollar tomorrow
### Types of Financial Markets
   
- Money markets: short term (< 1 year)
- Capital markets: medium- to long-term
- Derivatives markets: transference of risk
- Foreign exhange markets: facilitaets international trade, supports money and capital markets

Quiz in tutorial next week on THIS stuff
**Bond**: contract between lender and borrower
Present and Future Value  
Answers and shit to 2DP
If choice between $1 today or in the future, then ALWAYS choose today, as you can invest it and it will be have grown in a year.
Percentages expressed in decimal form i.e. [0.1*2] = 10 percent times 2
**SIMPLE**:FV=F<sub>0</sub> + F<sub>0</sub>r<sub>s</sub>n
= F + (1 + rsn)
= $1 (1 + [0.1*2])
= $1.20
PV=FV/(1 + r<sub>s</sub>n)
**COMPOUND**: 
FV = PV/(1+r)^n ????? fix this (by reading the book, amazing!)

**Future Value of Multiple Cash Flows**: Treated like single cash flows and added up. 
Timelines are handy for all questions.
**Annuities**: A finite number of cash flows that are equal in their amounts and are evenly spaced. 3 types:
- Ordinary Annuities: when time between now and first payment is the same as all other times.
- Annuities Due: first cash flow occurs immediately.
- Deferred Annuities: first cash flow starts at some time in the future.


**FV of Annuities**: 
**FV of Ordinary Annuities/Deffered Annuities** = FV=F[((1+r)^n-1)/r)]
Remember that test is closed book, so need to **MEMORISE** these.
**FV of Annuity Due** = FV=F[((1+r)^n-1)/r)]\(1+r)

**Present Value of Multiple Cash Flows**
Can either:
- Discount each cash plow individually and sum the resultant values to calculate the present value
*or*
- In the case of **identical evenly** spaced cash flows, we can use the present value of an annuity formula
PV = 300/(1.10) + 290/(1.10)^2 + 500/(110)^3 + 580/(1.10)^4
(Need to do this this way because although these are evenly spaced, not of the same value)

PV of OA = F[(1-(1+r)^(**-**n))/r]
PV of AD = F + F[(1-(1+r)^(**-**(n-1)))/r]
PV of DA = (F[(1-(1+r)^-n)/r])/(1+r)^(m-1), where m is the number of periods before commencement
Make a formula sheet to learn. Ask anna for paper tonight??

**Perpetuities**: Cash flows that go on forever.
PV of OP = F/r
PV of PD = F + (F/r)
PV of DP = ((F/r))/(1+r)^(m-1)

Create a formula book, so that I can get these formulas looking much nicer and in an actually readable format
  
Cash flow period **MUST** match the interest rate, i.e. montly payments needs interest per month

**Types of Interest Rates**:
1. **Annual Effective Rate**: per annum (p.a.) with nothing afterwards
2. **Annual Nominal Interest Rate**: p.a. comp. semiannual (2), quarterly (4), monthly (12), fortnightly (26), weekly (52), daily (365)
3. **Periodic Interest Rate**: per month, per fortnight, per week. No p.a., much nicer!

Need to be able to convert between these 3

For **all** non-annual cash flows, use the *periodic interest rate*. 

Print/write out this wheel thing
Go through some examples for this later, to help get it right, Need to do lots of questions to get these formulae memorised.

Don’t round until final answer

If the question doesn’t state when it starts, assume it’s an ordinary annuity

**THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY: VALUING SHARES**
read 169-190, making sure to skip over the stuff that we don’t need to read

Shareholders OWN part of the company, but they have nothing to do with the running of the company

Shareholders elect the Board of Directors, who hire the management team (CEO, CFO, CMO, CIO, etc.), and then the BoD reports to the shareholders on current events to do with the company.

**Ordinary Shares**: An equity security that the gives the holder the right to vote and the right to any variable dividend.

**Preference Shares**: Given priority over ordinary shareholders and gives the rights to fixed dividends, generally have no voting rights.

**3 steps to asset valuation**:
1. Identify all the cash flows generated by the asset as well as when they occur
2. Find the present value of each cash flow that was identified 1 and
3. Sum the values of all cash flows calculated in 2


## W2

Actually do these questions… 
**Remember to use a timeline for *ALL* time value of money questions**
Another quiz next week (so actually know your shit by then)
Qn. 1 - use the D<sub>1</sub> formula, as it’s for one year from today
Qn. 2 - deferred perpetuity formula P<sub>2</sub>/(1 + r<sub>e</sub>)<sup>2</sup>? should 398.60. So get P<sub>2</sub> from the OP formula, then use that with this one as well.
Qn. 3 - echo?
Qn. 4 - book
Qn. 5 - transposition
Qn. 6 -

**Valuing Debt Instruments**
Debt is a *contractual* agreement, it MUST be paid. Often a cause of bankruptcy. 

**Coupon-paying Bond**: a contract in which the borrower (writer of the bond that is sold) agrees to pay the lender periodic interest (c) for a pre-defined number (n) periods.  More specifically, the periodic interest payment is known as a coupon payment (C), which is equal to the coupon rate multiplied by the face value (or cF); and, 
Coupons are almost always paid on a semi-annual basis.
Repay the face value, F of the instrument at a pre-defined maturity date. 

**Zero-coupon Bonds**: Does not pay coupons during its life. Instead, only the face value (F) is repaid at the end of *n* perdiods. Issued for a price below their face value, known as *discount securities*.

**Four major types of corp. bonds**:
- Bank Accepted Bills
- Mortgage Bonds
- Debentures: 
- Convertible Bonds: can be exchanged for shares in the corporation

*Unless told otherwise*, ALWAYS assume semi-annually and face value is $100 for coupon-paying bonds.

If coupons are other than semi-annual, quoted as annual nominal rates with compounding frequency to match the frequency of coupon payments. 

*Unless told otherwise*, zero-coupon bonds with maturities > 1 year assume yield is quoted an an annual effective rate. Where < 1 year, assume an annual nominal rate with a compounding frequency that matches the time until bond maturity.

3. AC =/= marginal cost, so you should probs go down if people aren’t going to buy the tickets at $500, so you’ll still be able to earn something, just not as much as before.

## T2

1. Much less coffee would be sold for a much higher price than usual due to a low supply, but this may be offset by an increase in the quantity of tea sold, as tea will have a lower price than usual, so the demand for coffee may not be as high as it was before.
2. ~~False, as she considers soda to be an inferior good, so her total expenditure on soda would fall, not on meat pies.~~ Inferior = more likely to be bought when low income, not that she prefers to buy it at all times. So, spending less on pies, not soda. True.
3. False, due to the much lower supply.
4. False, justs changes demand sort of thing. Refer to graph.
5. False, because qs = qd

## T3
Next week have to go to another tutorial due to public holiday, but don’t necessarily have to.

1. Specific brand, as the price of all petrol going up would have a smaller effect, because petrol is not a luxury item for most people. A specific brand, however, may lose sales if it’s price were to increase or gain sales if it’s price lowered. Specific because it’s more elastic.
2. A greater gold yield from the ore requires less of the ore to be mined, which would decrease the need for mines, and the increasing supply of gold would lower the price, making the mines less profitable and further impacting on their industry.
3. t/u, probs u, unsure what the marginal benefit would be for the 7th doughnut.
4.

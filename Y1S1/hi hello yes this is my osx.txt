hi hello yes this is my osx setup
today we have:
- ncmpcpp with best band going (not best album though)
- [iTerm2-borderless-with-padding](http://linktoit.com)
- [hammerspoon](http://hammerspoon.org) for window management. Used to move and resize windows, and also to bind keys to actions in certain applications that don’t have shortcuts. Super powerful, super recommended.
- [iA Writer](). That’s what this is! I felt a little undewhelmed at first, then I realised that all of this could be exported into amazing looking documents and pdfs! Beautiful program, highly recommended.
- [screenfetch]() to give me something to put in the exxtra terminal!
- [brew]() for package management. I also use [pkgin](), which is bad because 2 things is bad and I’m bad but it’s still working so far!
- base16-grayscale light, slightly altered as one of the colors was too light to tell the difference between this and the background.


I’m was working on getting XQuartz set up, but the power of Hammerspoon has made that seem far less important than I thought. 

And of course, all of this is runnning on my 2015 Macbook (yeah, the one port one). Much nicer machine than I was expecting, even if it did take over an hour to build gcc… Times like that I want my 5820K.

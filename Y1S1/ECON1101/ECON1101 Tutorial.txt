3. AC =/= marginal cost, so you should probs go down if people aren’t going to buy the tickets at $500, so you’ll still be able to earn something, just not as much as before.

## T2

1. Much less coffee would be sold for a much higher price than usual due to a low supply, but this may be offset by an increase in the quantity of tea sold, as tea will have a lower price than usual, so the demand for coffee may not be as high as it was before.
2. ~~False, as she considers soda to be an inferior good, so her total expenditure on soda would fall, not on meat pies.~~ Inferior = more likely to be bought when low income, not that she prefers to buy it at all times. So, spending less on pies, not soda. True.
3. False, due to the much lower supply.
4. False, justs changes demand sort of thing. Refer to graph.
5. False, because qs = qd

## T3
Next week have to go to another tutorial due to public holiday, but don’t necessarily have to.

1. Specific brand, as the price of all petrol going up would have a smaller effect, because petrol is not a luxury item for most people. A specific brand, however, may lose sales if it’s price were to increase or gain sales if it’s price lowered. Specific because it’s more elastic.
2. A greater gold yield from the ore requires less of the ore to be mined, which would decrease the need for mines, and the increasing supply of gold would lower the price, making the mines less profitable and further impacting on their industry.
3. t/u, probs u, unsure what the marginal benefit would be for the 7th doughnut.
4. 


## T5
1a. True, as their will be less flights to these locations, so they will not earn as much. The flights that do run to these areas will carry less passengers, resulting in possible losses.
 b. False, as they will avoid these areas. Although it could be argued as true, as they will not now go to these areas if they had previously wanted to.

2. The tutors will be hurt, and so will the university, but the students would most likely benefit. So I think means yes, but it could be no. So no, it is not?????? Maybs come talk to him during consult time so that we can get this part clear and stop having issues with it because that could really fuck me over in the exam....

3a. Most likely not, as petrol sellers would most likely increase the price as they could earn and retain more to a certain extent. 
 b. false
Notes:
Both price and quantity drop, so the producers are definitely hurt. 
Ambiguous for consumers rather than a good thing
Both consumers and producers bear the tax

## T7
No 6 because memes

For LR equilibrium, no incentive for firms to enter or exit, due to no +ve or -ve profits in the SR

Monopolists will charge where price is elastic, not inelastic
MR = MC



## T9

AFC gets lower as Q increases
Nash Equilibrium: neither firm has an incentive to change their strategy 
NE can exist without a dominant strategy
NE for this example is NE = (250,250)
coop outcome is to both charge higher price, as this is a better payout than both charging low
Both pricing low would result in Pareto Inefficiency


## T10
1. No, as this covers only the depreciation cost, not the interest included in the implicit rental cost.
2. Simple maths, not hard to do tbh. Not entirely sure why you skipped this one because that was a dumb idea. 
You were basically right, so you should have gone with that answer! Talks about implicit rental price of capital
3. to do with the efficient market hypothesis

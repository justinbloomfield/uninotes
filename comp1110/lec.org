*** Java Variables 

- *Instance*
  - non-static fields, object-local
  - each object has its own version (instance) in the field
- *Class*
  - Static fields, global
  - Exactly one version of the field exists
- *Local*
  - Temporary state, limited to execution scope of code
- *Parameters*
  - Temporary state, limited to execution scope, passed form one method to another


Java names:
- are case-sensitive
- whitespace not permitted
- $, _ not permitted
- Java keywords and reserved words cannot be used

Captilazation conventions:
- class names start with capital letters (=Bike=)
- variable names start with lower cas, and use upper case for subsequent word (=currentGear=)
- constant names use all caps and underscores (MAX\textunderscore GEAR\textunderscore RATIO)

*** Java's Primitive data types

| type    | description                                            | rang           | default |
|---------+--------------------------------------------------------+----------------+---------|
| byte    | 8-bit signed 2's complement integer                    | -128 - 127     | 0       |
| short   | 16-bit signed 2's complement integer                   | -32768 - 32767 | 0       |
| int     | 32-bit signed 2's complement integer                   | -2^31 - 2^31-1 | 0       |
| long    | 64-bit signed 2's complement integer                   | -2^63 - 2^63-1 | 0L      |
| float   | single precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point number |                | 0.0f    |
| double  | double precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number |                | 0.0d    |
| boolean | logically just a single bit: true /or/ false           | true, false    | ????    |
| char    | 16-bit Unicode character                               | 0 - 65?        | ????    |

*** Java Literals
- When a numerical value, e.g. 1, appears, the compier normally knows exactl what it means
- Special cases:
  - An integer value is a `long` if it ends with 'l' or 'L'
  - The prefix `0x` indicates hexadecimal, `0b` is binary
    - 0x30 // 48 epressed in hex
    - 0b110000 // 48 expressed in binary
  - An `f` indicates a `float` while d indicates double
  - Underscores may be used to break up numbers
    - long creditCardNumber = 1234_5678_9012_3456




** L2

*** Java Arrays

Arrays hold a fixed number of values of a given type (or sub type)

- Declaring: \mintinline{java}{int[] values;}

- Initializing: \mintinline{java}{values = new int[8];} for an 8 element array

- Accessing: \mintinline{java}{int x = values[3];} accessing the 4th element

- Copying: \mintinline{java}{System.arraycopy(0, y, 0, 8)}


*** Java Operators

- Assignment: \mintinline{java}{=}

- Arithmetic: \mintinline{java}{+ - * / %}

- Unary: \mintinline{java}{+ - ++ -- !}

- Equality, relational conditional and \mintinline{java}{instanceof}: \mintinline{java}{== != > >= < <= && || instanceof}

- Bitwise: \mintinline{java}{~ & ^ | << >> >>>}

*** Expressions

A construct that evaluates to a *single value*

Made up of:
- variables
- operators
- method invocations
*STILL NEED TO GRAB THE REST OF THIS*

i++ -> i = i + 1
*** Control Flow 1 (J5)

Imperative programming has three components:
- Sequence: one thing after another
- Selection: choices / options on where/what the program can go/do
- Iteration: 

**** If-else
- \mintinline{java}{if-then & if-then-else} statements
  - can be nested, ifs within ifs (in some cases though else-if is a better fit)
  - take the form of
#+begin_src java
    if (condition) {
        body;
    } else-if (condition) {
        body;
    } else {
        body;
    }
#+end_src

**** switch statements
- \mintinline{java}{switch} selects one path among many
  - Execution "jumps" to the first matching \mintinline{java}{case}
  - Execution continues unless a \mintinline{java}{break} statement is issued
  - \mintinline{java}{default} is used to perform an action when no case statement is met
  - Works thus:
#+begin_src java
switch (var) {
    case var_value;
        body for case;
        break; // need to put this in to stop at this statement, otherwise it just keeps going lol
    case var_value2;
        body for case;
        break; 
    ...etc...
    default:
        body for no matches;
}
#+end_src

*** Control Flow 2 (J6)

**** While and do-while
- The \mintinline{java}{while} statement executes continuously while condition is \mintinline{java}{true}
- The \mintinline{java}{do-while} evaluates conditional at the *end* of the statement
#+begin_src java
while (condition) {
    body;
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src java
do {
    body;
} while (condition);
#+end_src

**** For

A compact way to iterate over a set of variables

Statement has 3 logical parts:
- Inititialization
- Termination condition
- Increment statement

#+begin_src java
for (type var = x; x < y; x++ or some other action) {
    body;
}

// print all items in array
for (int v : array) (
    body; // e.g. System.out.println("value of array at this index is " + v);
)
#+end_src

**** Branching statements (loops)
- The \mintinline{java}{break} statement terminates a loop costruct
- The \mintinline{java}{continue} statement repeats the loop construct

*** Methods (J7)

- A subroutine
  - Reusable code
  - Modularity, encapsulation
- May take arguments
- _*May*_ return a value

**** Method Declaration

Method declarations will have the following, in order;
- Any modifiers (\mintinline{java}{public}, \mintinline{java}{private}, etc)
- return type
- name
- parameters, in parentheses
- exceptions the method may throw
- body 

**** Class and Instance methods

     A method declared with the \mintinline{java}{static} modifier is a *class* method (otherwise it is an *instance* method)

Class methods may operate *on class fields only*

Instance methods may operate on class *and* instance fields

**** Parameters

     Parameters are the mechanism for passing iformation to a method or constructor

- Primitive types passed by /value/
  - changes to par *are not seen* by caller
- Reference types passed by /value/
  - Changes to the /reference/ *are not seen* by caller
  - CHanges to /object referred to/ *are not seen* by caller
- Your last parameter may in fact be more than one parameter (/varargs/), and treated as an array

**** Branching (methods)

     The \mintinline{java}{return} statement exits the current method

**** Returning a value from a method

Methods return to caller when:
- all statemens in method are executed, or
- \mintinline{java}{return} is reached
- method throws exceptions

Methods declared \mintinline{java}{void} return nothing

*** Classes and Objects 1 (O1)

**** Class declaration
A class declaration will have the following, in order:
- modifiers
- keyword \mintinline{java}{class}
- class' name (first letter capitalized)
- optional superclass' name precede by \mintinline{java}{extends}
- optional list of interfaces preceded by \mintinline{java}{implements}
- body, in {}

**** Member Variable Declaration

Three kinds:
- Class and instance variable (fields)
- Variables within method (local variables)
- arguments (parameters)

MORE HERE FOR THIS PART

**** Constructors

A special method that is automatically executed when an instance is created

Constructors differ from normal methods:
LIST OF SHIT

**** Creating objecs
fuck this omg

**** Using objects

Go over this bit, hard to understand when you aren' paying proper attention and you've had to skip over a whole bunch of stuff as well

** L2 

*** Classes and  Objects 2

**** Locals (stack), Globals (statics), and Heap (objects)

- *Local* variables are declared within the scope of a method and hold temporary state, disappear once the method returns
- *Global* variables (aka /class variables/) are declared within the scope of a class (with a \mintinline{java}{static} qualifier), and last als long as the class is loaded (usually duration of the program)
- *Heap* variabes (/instance variables/) are declared within the scope of a class (*without* the \mintinline{java}{static} qualifier), and last as long as the containing instance is reachable


**** Garbage Collection

In some object oriented languages, the programmer must keep track of objects and delete them when they are no longer used. This is error prone.

Java uses a garbage collector to automatically collect objects that can *no longer be used*. Garbage collection approximates liveness by reachability (the collector conservatively assumes that any reachable object is live).

**** The \mintinline{java}{this} keyword

     Within instance methods and constructors, the \mintinline{java}{this} keyword refers to the object whose method or constructor is being called

- Disambiguating field names form parameters
- Calling other constructors

**** Access Control

Access modifiers determine whether fields and methods may be accessed by other classes

- Top level: \mintinline{java}{public} or /package-private/
- Member level: \mintinline{java}{public}, \mintinline{java}{protected}, /package-private/, or \mintinline{java}{private}

| Modifier                     | Class      | Package    | Subclass   | World      |
|------------------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------|
| \mintinline{java}{public}    | \checkmark | \checkmark | \checkmark | \checkmark |
| \mintinline{java}{protected} | \checkmark | \checkmark | \checkmark | \times     |
| /no modifier/                | \checkmark | \checkmark | \times     | \times     |
| \mintinline{java}{private}   | \checkmark | \times     | \times     | \times     |

**** Class and Instance Members

     The \mintinline{java}{static} keyword identifies class variable, class methods and constants
- A *class variable* is common to all objects (only one version)
- A *class method* is einvoked using a class name (not an object reference) and executes independently of any particular object
- A *constant* can be declared by combining the \mintinline{java}{final} modifier with the \mintinline{java}{static} keyword

**** Initializers

     Fields may be initialized when they are declared. They can also be initialized by *initializer blocks*, which can initialize fields using arbitrarily complex code (error handling, loops, etc)
- A statict initalizer block consists of code enclosed by braces '{}' and preceded by the \mintinline{java}{static} keyword
- An instance initializer block is similar , but does nat have the \mintinline{java}{static} keyword

**** Enum Types

     Defined with the \mintinline{java}{enum} keyword. 
Consists of a fixed set of onstants as its fields.
This is useful for defining non-numerical sets such as NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, or HD, D, CR, P, N, etc.

- May have other *fields*
- May have *methods*
- May use *constructors*
- Can be used as argument to *iterators*

\pagebreak

Created like so: 
#+begin_src java
public enum Gender {
    Female, Male
}
#+end_src

Which can be referred to like: \mintinline{java}{Gender gender}

Calling parent constructor: \mintinline{java}{super(name, age, gender);} to inherit values from parent. New values need to be assigned as normal.

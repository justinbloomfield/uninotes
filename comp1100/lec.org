* COMP1100 - Programming as Problem Solving

* Wk 1 
** Lecture 1 - Intro
This was super boring and nothing happened lmao

** Lecture 2 - Binaries

Conversions:
- Divide number by base to which you are converting
- Prepend remainder to result string
- Replace number by quotient
- repeat until quotient is 

(hand example it's fucking weird)

This negative number shit is whack yo

| Number                   | View                          |
|--------------------------+-------------------------------|
| $00101010_{2}$           | Binary                        |
| $42_{10}$                | decimal, but not great        |
| $0010_{2} 1010_{2}$      | two groups of 4 to create...  |
| $2A_{16}$                | ...Hexadecimal                |
| $00_{2} 101_{2} 010_{2}$ | Or, three groups to create... |
| $052_{8}$                | ...Octal                      |

* Week 2

** Lecture 1 - Programming

*** Imperative vs Declarative 
(there's a difference here but it's not in the slides so watch it, also start going to the lecture pls)

Influential Languages:
- Conceptual Foundations: \lambda calculus/Lisp, Simula/Smalltalk, Algol, Prolog
- Also influential: ML/Haskell, Pascal, Eiffel, Ada, Modula-3, C, Java

*** How software is executed

- *Compiler*: program the translates source program into machin instructions, e.g. Haskell
- *Interpreter*: program that interprets (executes) a source program, e.g. Smalltalk, Perl

Many languages have been implemented using both compilers and interpereters, including BASIC, C, Lisp, Pascal, Python...

*** Programming myths

- "It's easy, everybody can do it with just a few tutorials." - salespeople hopping on a hype train for a language (fuck you Rust)
- "It's intrinsically hard." - old programmers say to keep their jobs
- "A weird way to spend your day." - stereotyping

** Lecture 2 - Haskell, Basic Types, Guards

*** Haskell

/*Function: a relation between two sets with the property that for each element of the first set there is exactly one element form the second set*/

Haskell is *pure* because only functions in a mathematical sense of a function can be written in Haskell.

**** Mathematical functions

- There can be no communication with the outside world, i.e. no communication with other shit between the inputs and the outputs
- The function can not hold values internally after the function has been evaluated
- The function cannot write to its input values

*** The Essence of Functional programming

- Types model objects in the public domain
- Programming means defining types and writing functions over types
- Computing with functions means evaluation (reduction)
- Variables name values and cannot vary
- Functions have no side-effects


/*Haskell is functional*/

- Functions are *first-class*, i.e. functions are values which can be used in exactly the same way as other sorts of values
- The meaning of Haskell programs is centered around *evaluating expressions* rather than *executing instructions*
- Taken together, these result in an entirely different way of thinking about programming. Much of our time this semester will be spent exploring this way of thinking.

/*Haskell is Pure*/

Haskel functions are always *referentially transparent*:
- no mutations; everything (variables, data structures ...) is *immutable*
- expressions are side-effect free
- programs are *deterministic* - calling the same function with the same arguments results in the same output

Benefits of this:
- equation reasoning and refactoring: "replace equals by"
- parallelism: evaluating in parallel is easy when no side effects
- fewer headaches: easier to debug, maintain, and reason about programs

/*Haskell is lazy*/

Expressions are not evaluated until their results are needed

- It is possible to design and work with *infinite data structures*
- It enables a more compositional programming style
- /but/ it makes reasoning about time and space usage more difficult

*** The Essence of Haskell programming

- Programs are *higher level*: define relationship between input and output (the "what") rather than the "how" to compute a result
- *First class functions* can be passed around like any other data
- Functions have *no side-effects*, *monads* embed side-effects inside Haskell and its type system
- Haskell programs are easy to parallelise: there is no shared state
- Definitions are *equations*: easy to validate properties, allowing proofs
- Haskell programs are easy to *refactor

* COMP1100 - Programming as Problem Solving

* Wk 1 
** Lecture 1 - Intro
This was super boring and nothing happened lmao

** Lecture 2 - Binaries

Conversions:
- Divide number by base to which you are converting
- Prepend remainder to result string
- Replace number by quotient
- repeat until quotient is 

(hand example it's fucking weird)

This negative number shit is whack yo

| $00101010_{2}$           | Binary                        |
| $42_{10}$                | decimal, but not great        |
| $0010_{2} 1010_{2}$      | two groups of 4 to create...  |
| $2A_{16}$                | ...Hexadecimal                |
| $00_{2} 101_{2} 010_{2}$ | Or, three groups to create... |
| $052_{8}$                | ...Octal                      |

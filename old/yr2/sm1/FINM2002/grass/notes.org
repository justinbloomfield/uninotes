* Shit to include
- Trump (post-election, Syria, relations with Russia)
- Le Pen (winning = france possibly out of EU), which is related to...
- Britain leaving the EU.  France leaving could have a similar impact, although whether that would be higher or lower can be discussed
  - Higher: that makes 2 countries leaving the EU, which could be taken by speculators to be the beginning of it's dissolution
  - Lower: France not really as globally prominent as the UK, and also having seen that Brexit has yet to have a real effect on the global economy, the reaction to it could be less
- Agression and tension relating to North Korea - related to countries involved in tension, potentially those around the area as well (Japan, China, SK)

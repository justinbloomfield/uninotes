## T1


2. Possibly, as while an individual may prefer to buy one product over another, but crowd/market mentality may choose a different good compared to the individiual. *Micro level: everyone knows iphone is shit, ***BUT*** also know others will purchase them, Macro level: price of asset keeps going up due to speculation, "this smartphone business is ridic yo", better example would be GFC, apply to what I've already written*
3. Theories are based on very, very simplified versions of markets and people, so **ANY** model is by default unrealistic, therefore it's unfair to call one unrealistic.
4. 

5. Positive, as it is what will be, rather than what should be. Deals with facts, rather than with ideals.

6. 1. Consumer Income: exo
   2. exo
   3. exo
   4,5,6. end


DEFINE, EXPLAIN, APPLY

## T2

1. Less money came into countries from others for both imports and exports, so I’m not sure how big an effect that would have had. Although it would only cancel it out if a country relied equally on imports and exports for income. Local firms would have been relied upon more heavily, helping local economies??? Due to tariffs, which made imports too expensive. Meant to increase local economies over others.
2. PPF = production possibilities frontier. Idfk, I can’t think of a way to apply it. Potential Reasons: No trade, less resources as a result, high unemployment. Yes AND no. Shows some effects, but many other things (e.g. demand side and events) are left out
3. Shit was too messed up, normally it would have worked but debt was too large a factor in the economic climate, preventing the return to equilibrium. Cost and wages reduced, so not much change in real income, but debts stayed the same. Feeds off itself, makes it worse. Across diff markets, instead of achieving equilibrium again when one worsens, all markets suffer, and collapse together
4. Graph is saying that stuff was at it’s worst in about ’32. After that, things started to improve, and in some cases became better than before the crash, such as GDP. Also seems to show that of all the countries represented, America struggled the most. 
- Relationship between the sectors: Increase in financial not always a good thing, whereas graph of increasing Real GDP shows that there was an actual improvement in the economy. 

REAL SECTOR = actual production
FINANCIAL SECTOR = prices of shit

### L2

**Macroeconomics**: 
- Emphasis on the 'A' for the aggregate economy.
- Study of the performance of the national and global economies

**Normative Economics**: study of what ought to be
**Positive Economics**: study of what is

**Correlation**: statistical relationship between two (or more) sets of data

**Key Assumptions**: Assume that people are:
- Rational
- Maximizing (prefer more to less)
- Self-interested ( care first about themselves, only secondly about others)

**Elements of a typical model**:
- *Parameters*: inputs fixed over time
- *Variables*: inputs that change over time, two types:
1. **Endogenous**: explained by the model
2. **Exodogenous**: determined outside the model
- *Functional Relations*: rules that characterize the realtaionship between two or more endogenous variables in a model

**Fallacy Of Composition**: sum of the parts always equal to the whole, which is WRONG


### L3

**Technical Efficiency**: Macimum output for minimum input
**National Income Accounting**: Government's methodology for keeping track of measures of aggregate economic activity

**Circular Flow Model**
- Start by assuming a *close economy* (operates in a state of autarky) (*open economy*: economy which trades with other economies)

## W2
### L1

We have the actual lecturer today, amazing!

**Introduction to the Great Depression**


### L2

Be sure to get all the shit from L5 this weekend brother

Emergency Banking Act, March 6, 1933 - closed the banks under a national ‘banking holiday’ to help stabilise the crisis

### L3

**National Income and Product Accounting**

National income accounting provides a systematic method of  aggregating the production of diverse goods into a single measure of overall economic activity as traded in and/or valued by market exchanges 
Conceptually based on circular flow model
Production function also basic concept behind national income accounts
Y = f (K, L, La)
Y (output) dependent on K (amount of capital), L (Land) and La (Labour) used
NIA conceptually measure the total economy:
- as a machine in which inputs are transformed thorough various processes to yield outputs
- a flow of output being recycled through consumption and investment spending and factor payments

**GDP**: is the market value of the final goods and services produced in an economy over a certain period

PRODUCTION = EXPENDITURE = INCOME
- Expenditure measure of GDP counts the total purchases in the economy
- Income measure of GDP counts all the income earned in the economy
- Production measure of GDP counts the number of goods produced in the economy

GDP = C + I + G + NX
C (Consumption), I (Investment), G (Government), NX (Net Exports)

NX = Merchandise exports - Imports
Negative NX is a “leakage” from a domestic economy because some economic expenditure is in effect flowing out of the country into the rest of the world
## W3
### L1

**Income Approach to GDP**: Measures sum of all income earned in the economy
**Production Approach to GDP**: 
- Amount each producer contributes to GDP is called *value added*
- Value add = revenue gen. by each producer - value of intermediate products
- *Primary producer + Intermediate producer = final producer*

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: total value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a one-year period (produced within borders)
**Gross National Product (GNP)**: aggregate final outpt of citizens and businesses of an economy in one year. GNP = GDP + net foreign factor income
**Net Foreign Factor Income**: income from foreign domestic factor sources minus foreign factor income earned domestically

**Wealth Accounts**: Represent a balance sheet of an economy's assets and liablilities and is a *stock* of collect flows measured at a point in time
**Real Wealth**: the value of the productive capactiry of the assets of an economy measured by the goods and services it can produce now and in the future
**Nominal Wealth**: the value of those assets measured at current market prices

Only goods and services that are transacted through markets are included in GDP, i.e. must be market value assigned to it through the market. 
Does not include:
- Changes in environmental conditions
- a measure of the health of a nations people
- underground/"black market" shizzle
Only includes activity thatn can be identified in the fom of a recognised exchaneg transaction, usually market-based


### L3

"Rule of 70": Doubling of gdp is some shit like 70/g

## W4
### L1

Showed a whole bunch of models, not sure if we need to know those or not

**Net Payoff**: a way of rummarizing the key relationships: real output per hour (Y/L) and capital per hour (K/L), with technology determining the shape of the curve

Workers become more productive with more capital *only up to a point*

Some countries are more efficient at using capital and labour for some reaons:
1. human capital
2. Technology
3. Institutions
4. Exogenous shocks

**Human Capital**: Stock of ckills that individuals accumulate to make them more productive, analogous to physical capital. Improved through education, health,
**Institutions** refers to property rights, rule of lar, government systems, organisational form, contract enforcement, etc.
**Exogenous Shocks**: war, famine, plague and death, or stuff like drastic changes in oil prices, 

### L2

**Economies of Scale**

Increasing returns to scale: Average cost of production falls as production increases
Decreasing returns to scale: Average cost of production rises as production increases

Productivity is never the sole cause of GDP growth.

**Innovation and something or other**
- Innovation by itself does not necessarily lead to new growth and productivity
- A new product may not meet a clear need or desire in which case it will go nowhere economically and may even represent a waste of economic resources
- Some innovations may impose significat costs on society

**Creative destruction and entrepreneurship**
- Innovation and enrepreneurship is risky because its outcomes are higly unceratin. Such activities may not have a tangible outcome.
(THERES MORE OF THIS)


Per capita GDP ≠ Standard of living

## WEEK 5
### L1

**Labour and Unemployment**

**Labour Demand Curve**: Derived from the firm's profit maximization objective in which firms hire forkers until the Marginal Product of Labour equals the wage rate. This curve slopes downwards becaue of the diminishing marginal product of labour and beause output and input markets are perfectly competitive, i.e. as we add more workers and hol all else equal, each additional worker produces less

**Labour Supply Curve**: Describes the entire supply of labour as probeded by the whol labour force. Slopes upfard because the opportunity cost of leisure and the reward for working is higer.

An increase in income tax reduces labour supply and employment declines and wages increase
Government subsidies of Australian automakers are withdrawn, in the short term labour demand falls, employments falls and wages fall
Government regulation imposing a floor on wages: creates an excess supply of labour

**Discouraged Workers**: People without jobs whho give up looking for work
**Participation Rate**: number of people who are either emplover or are actively looking for work
**Labour Force**: Those able and willing to look for work

Unemployment Rate: Unemployed / Labour Force
Labour Force: Employed + Unemployed
Participation Rate: Labour force / Population

**Problems with mearsuing the unemployment rate**
1. Number of discouraged workers increases during a recession; therefore the official unemployment rate appears lowew than it would otherwise be.
2. Under-employed workers: people who work part-time but would like to work more hours
3. People who clain to be unemployed but are not can lead to the unemployment rate being over-stated. 

### L2

Educational attainment is associated with less long-term unemployment
Workers may not get the job they desire in the field they desire or at the pay they desire
Job creation and destruction is a normal part of any economy

**Natural Rate of Unemployment**: The unemployment rate that exists when the economy is operating at potential GDP
**Non-accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU)**: The level of unemployment below which th erete of inflation will rise

**Four types of unemployment**:
1. Cyclical unemployment: unemployment caused by a business cycle contraction
2. Frictional Unemployment: Short-term unemployment arising from the process of matching workers with jobs, e.g. uni finishers, school leavers
3. Seasonal Unemployment: Unemployment due to factors such as weather, variations in tourism and other calendar-related events
4. Structural Unemployment: Unemployment arising from a persistent mismatch between the skills and characteristics of workers and the requirements of jobs


### L3

Actual unemployent = frictional + structural + cyclical  
Natural = frictional + structural

**Cost of unemployment**:
- Loss of GDP (through lower L) and opportunity cost of ‘slack’ human capital
- Loss or deterioration of human capital
- Retraining costs
- Financial costs to the government (e.g. unemployment benefits, loss of tax revenue)

**Costs to the individual**:
- Loss of income
- Loss of skills
- Retraining costs
- Social costs: family issues, mental health, crime, etc.



## W6 - INFLATION
### L1

There is a distinction between the **Real Economy**, which refers to the economy of the physical world, where physical goods and services are produced and consumed and the **financial/monetary economy**, which refers to the *money economy*,

Financial Markets allow consumers and trade off future and present consumption and production against one another. Helps market expand more than it would otherwise.

Financial Markets allow those with funds to communicate with those in need of funds.

**I = Y - C - G** — investment is a *residual* left over after private individuals and the public sector spends its share of output (Y).

**Dissaving**: Negative saving. Spending more than is available to them in the economy.

**Inflation**: A general rise in the price level
Nominal GDP = Real GDP \* Price Level

### L2

Inflation causes redistributions of wealth and income that have no particular economic merit and which are driven purely by changes in money prices (including interest rates) in the short-run

Debtors benefit from lower rates, savers are worse off.

INflation can cause tax distortions, ‘bracket creep’ is a classic example. People in lower categories are being pushed upwards by inflation.

**Real interest rate**: Equal to the marginal product of capital and is paid in goods

**Nominal interest rate**: rate on a savings account and is paid in dollars

**Fisher Equation**: ***i = r + π***
, where i = nr, r = rr, π = rate of inflation

Interest determines the ‘price’ of money

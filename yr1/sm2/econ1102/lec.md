**Correlation**: statistical relationship between two (or more) sets of data

**Key Assumptions**: Assume that people are:

- Maximizing (prefer more to less)
- Self-interested ( care first about themselves, only secondly about others)

**Elements of a typical model**:
- *Parameters*: inputs fixed over time
- *Variables*: inputs that change over time, two types:
1. **Endogenous**: explained by the model
2. **Exodogenous**: determined outside the model
- *Functional Relations*: rules that characterize the realtaionship between two or more endogenous variables in a model

**Fallacy Of Composition**: sum of the parts always equal to the whole, which is WRONG


## L3

**Technical Efficiency**: Macimum output for minimum input

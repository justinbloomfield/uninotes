### L2

**Macroeconomics**: 
- Emphasis on the 'A' for the aggregate economy.
- Study of the performance of the national and global economies

**Normative Economics**: study of what ought to be
**Positive Economics**: study of what is

**Correlation**: statistical relationship between two (or more) sets of data

**Key Assumptions**: Assume that people are:
- Rational
- Maximizing (prefer more to less)
- Self-interested ( care first about themselves, only secondly about others)

**Elements of a typical model**:
- *Parameters*: inputs fixed over time
- *Variables*: inputs that change over time, two types:
1. **Endogenous**: explained by the model
2. **Exodogenous**: determined outside the model
- *Functional Relations*: rules that characterize the realtaionship between two or more endogenous variables in a model

**Fallacy Of Composition**: sum of the parts always equal to the whole, which is WRONG


### L3

**Technical Efficiency**: Macimum output for minimum input
**National Income Accounting**: Government's methodology for keeping track of measures of aggregate economic activity

**Circular Flow Model**
- Start by assuming a *close economy* (operates in a state of autarky) (*open economy*: economy which trades with other economies)

## W2
### L1

We have the actual lecturer today, amazing!

**Introduction to the Great Depression**


### L2


Emergency Banking Act, March 6, 1933 - closed the banks under a national ‘banking holiday’ to help stabilise the crisis

### L3

**National Income and Product Accounting**

National income accounting provides a systematic method of  aggregating the production of diverse goods into a single measure of overall economic activity as traded in and/or valued by market exchanges 
Conceptually based on circular flow model
Production function also basic concept behind national income accounts
Y = f (K, L, La)
Y (output) dependent on K (amount of capital), L (Land) and La (Labour) used
NIA conceptually measure the total economy:
- as a machine in which inputs are transformed thorough various processes to yield outputs
- a flow of output being recycled through consumption and investment spending and factor payments

**GDP**: is the market value of the final goods and services produced in an economy over a certain period

PRODUCTION = EXPENDITURE = INCOME
- Expenditure measure of GDP counts the total purchases in the economy
- Income measure of GDP counts all the income earned in the economy
- Production measure of GDP counts the number of goods produced in the economy

GDP = C + I + G + NX
C (Consumption), I (Investment), G (Government), NX (Net Exports)

NX = Merchandise exports - Imports
Negative NX is a “leakage” from a domestic economy because some economic expenditure is in effect flowing out of the country into the rest of the world
## W3
### L1

**Income Approach to GDP**: Measures sum of all income earned in the economy
**Production Approach to GDP**: 
- Amount each producer contributes to GDP is called *value added*
- Value add = revenue gen. by each producer - value of intermediate products
- *Primary producer + Intermediate producer = final producer*

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: total value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a one-year period (produced within borders)
**Gross National Product (GNP)**: aggregate final outpt of citizens and businesses of an economy in one year. GNP = GDP + net foreign factor income
**Net Foreign Factor Income**: income from foreign domestic factor sources minus foreign factor income earned domestically

**Wealth Accounts**: Represent a balance sheet of an economy's assets and liablilities and is a *stock* of collect flows measured at a point in time
**Real Wealth**: the value of the productive capactiry of the assets of an economy measured by the goods and services it can produce now and in the future
**Nominal Wealth**: the value of those assets measured at current market prices

Only goods and services that are transacted through markets are included in GDP, i.e. must be market value assigned to it through the market. 
Does not include:
- Changes in environmental conditions
- a measure of the health of a nations people
- underground/"black market" shizzle
Only includes activity thatn can be identified in the fom of a recognised exchaneg transaction, usually market-based


### L3

"Rule of 70": Doubling of gdp is some shit like 70/g

## W4
### L1

Showed a whole bunch of models, not sure if we need to know those or not

**Net Payoff**: a way of rummarizing the key relationships: real output per hour (Y/L) and capital per hour (K/L), with technology determining the shape of the curve

Workers become more productive with more capital *only up to a point*

Some countries are more efficient at using capital and labour for some reaons:
1. human capital
2. Technology
3. Institutions
4. Exogenous shocks

**Human Capital**: Stock of ckills that individuals accumulate to make them more productive, analogous to physical capital. Improved through education, health,
**Institutions** refers to property rights, rule of lar, government systems, organisational form, contract enforcement, etc.
**Exogenous Shocks**: war, famine, plague and death, or stuff like drastic changes in oil prices, 

### L2

**Economies of Scale**

Increasing returns to scale: Average cost of production falls as production increases
Decreasing returns to scale: Average cost of production rises as production increases

Productivity is never the sole cause of GDP growth.

**Innovation and something or other**
- Innovation by itself does not necessarily lead to new growth and productivity
- A new product may not meet a clear need or desire in which case it will go nowhere economically and may even represent a waste of economic resources
- Some innovations may impose significat costs on society

**Creative destruction and entrepreneurship**
- Innovation and enrepreneurship is risky because its outcomes are higly unceratin. Such activities may not have a tangible outcome.
(THERES MORE OF THIS)


Per capita GDP ≠ Standard of living

## W5
### L1

**Labour and Unemployment**

**Labour Demand Curve**: Derived from the firm's profit maximization objective in which firms hire forkers until the Marginal Product of Labour equals the wage rate. This curve slopes downwards becaue of the diminishing marginal product of labour and beause output and input markets are perfectly competitive, i.e. as we add more workers and hol all else equal, each additional worker produces less

**Labour Supply Curve**: Describes the entire supply of labour as probeded by the whol labour force. Slopes upfard because the opportunity cost of leisure and the reward for working is higer.

An increase in income tax reduces labour supply and employment declines and wages increase
Government subsidies of Australian automakers are withdrawn, in the short term labour demand falls, employments falls and wages fall
Government regulation imposing a floor on wages: creates an excess supply of labour

**Discouraged Workers**: People without jobs whho give up looking for work
**Participation Rate**: number of people who are either emplover or are actively looking for work
**Labour Force**: Those able and willing to look for work

Unemployment Rate: Unemployed / Labour Force
Labour Force: Employed + Unemployed
Participation Rate: Labour force / Population

**Problems with mearsuing the unemployment rate**
1. Number of discouraged workers increases during a recession; therefore the official unemployment rate appears lowew than it would otherwise be.
2. Under-employed workers: people who work part-time but would like to work more hours
3. People who clain to be unemployed but are not can lead to the unemployment rate being over-stated. 

### L2

Educational attainment is associated with less long-term unemployment
Workers may not get the job they desire in the field they desire or at the pay they desire
Job creation and destruction is a normal part of any economy

**Natural Rate of Unemployment**: The unemployment rate that exists when the economy is operating at potential GDP
**Non-accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU)**: The level of unemployment below which th erete of inflation will rise

**Four types of unemployment**:
1. Cyclical unemployment: unemployment caused by a business cycle contraction
2. Frictional Unemployment: Short-term unemployment arising from the process of matching workers with jobs, e.g. uni finishers, school leavers
3. Seasonal Unemployment: Unemployment due to factors such as weather, variations in tourism and other calendar-related events
4. Structural Unemployment: Unemployment arising from a persistent mismatch between the skills and characteristics of workers and the requirements of jobs


### L3

Actual unemployent = frictional + structural + cyclical  
Natural = frictional + structural

**Cost of unemployment**:
- Loss of GDP (through lower L) and opportunity cost of ‘slack’ human capital
- Loss or deterioration of human capital
- Retraining costs
- Financial costs to the government (e.g. unemployment benefits, loss of tax revenue)

**Costs to the individual**:
- Loss of income
- Loss of skills
- Retraining costs
- Social costs: family issues, mental health, crime, etc.



## W6 - INFLATION
### L1

There is a distinction between the **Real Economy**, which refers to the economy of the physical world, where physical goods and services are produced and consumed and the **financial/monetary economy**, which refers to the *money economy*,

Financial Markets allow consumers and trade off future and present consumption and production against one another. Helps market expand more than it would otherwise.

Financial Markets allow those with funds to communicate with those in need of funds.

**I = Y - C - G** — investment is a *residual* left over after private individuals and the public sector spends its share of output (Y).

**Dissaving**: Negative saving. Spending more than is available to them in the economy.

**Inflation**: A general rise in the price level
Nominal GDP = Real GDP \* Price Level

### L2

Inflation causes redistributions of wealth and income that have no particular economic merit and which are driven purely by changes in money prices (including interest rates) in the short-run

Debtors benefit from lower rates, savers are worse off.

INflation can cause tax distortions, ‘bracket creep’ is a classic example. People in lower categories are being pushed upwards by inflation.

**Real interest rate**: Equal to the marginal product of capital and is paid in goods

**Nominal interest rate**: rate on a savings account and is paid in dollars

**Fisher Equation**: ***i = r + π***
, where i = nr, r = rr, π = rate of inflation

Interest determines the ‘price’ of money

## W7
### L1
**Aggregate expenditure in the short run**

**Expenditure Accounting Identity**: Y = C + I + G + NX
Can turn this into a theory, and into a model

**Aggregate Expenditure**: Total amount of spending in the economy - sum of consumption, planned investment, govt. purchases and net exports. Assume that AE is a description of specific flows in a macro-economy for a specific time period.

Leads to the **Aggregrate Expenditure Model**: focuses on short-run relationship between total spending and real GDP. Assume price level is constant.

Now have:
AE = C + I + G + NX
Also define macro-equilibrium condition of AE = GDP

**Consumption (C)**:
- *current disposable income*: amount of money available to devote to spending after tax and transfer payments. "Current" refers to time period under analysis. 
- *expected future income*: self explanatory. If this is high, tends to raise spending, and if low, spending reduced.
- *household wealth*: accumulation of income in form of assets, financial (e.g. savings) and real (e.g. a house).
- *price level*: level of all prices, increases have three major 'channels' that influence spending:
  * price inflation decreases the real value of household wealth, -> lowered consumption via wealth effect
  * price inflation leads to an increased demand for cash, -> increases demand for loanable funds and interest rate, lowers consumption (especially that which is financed through debt)
  * domestic inflation will cause changes in international exchange rates and relative world prices
- *interest rate*

**Consumption Function*: C = f(DI, wealth, etc.). Can hold various things constant to reduce it to **C = f(DI)**
**C = A + MPC * DI**, where *marginal propensity to consume (MPC)* is the slope of the consumption function - MPC = change in consumption / change in disposable income
If MPC = 0.9, that means 90 cents of every new dollar of DI is spent
A is the 'autonomous' consumption that occurs regardless of DI (e.g. money spent on necessary things, such as food)

**Disposable Income = National Income - Net Taxes**
**National Income = GDP = Disposable Income + Net Taxes**

**Behaviour of I**
First need to determine savings (S), as this determines amount of money available to I.
If Y represents national income (and GDP), C represents consumption, S represents saving and T represents net taxes, we can write: **Y = C + S + T**

**Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)**: Change in saving / change in disposable income
Can further say that **1 = MPC + MPS**

**Change in national income = change in consumption + change in saving + change in net taxes**

*All S is available for I but not all is 'actively' invested*

Four most important variables that determine the level of planned investment are:
1. expectations of future profitability
2. the interest rate
3. taxes
4. cash flow
5. price level

### L2

**Expectations of Future Profitability**
Like consumers, investors (businesses) operate under uncertainty, so firms base their current investment spending on what they expect they're profitability to be going forward. 
These expectations can be affected by many things, some of them nonrational (e.g. emotional states like optimism/pessimism)

**Interest rate**: cost of money
Affects investment decisions
True for consumers as well but more important for businesses as debt finance is much more prevalent there

**Taxes**
Investment behaviour is also affected by taxes

**Cash Flow**
Cash flow = cash income - cash outflow

**Price Level**
Price level affects business investment too, through interest rate, increased need for cash, and changes in relative world prices and exchange rates


**Government Purchases**
Remember not to double count tranfer payments

**Net Exports**
Three most important factors in determining the level of NX:
1. Price level in Aus. relative to the price levels in other countries
2. Economic growth rate in Australia relative to the economic growth rates in other countries.
3. The exchange rate between the dollar and other currencies

### L3

**Autonomous v Induced Consumption**
**Autonomous Consumption**: consumption that is independent of income (and the intercept term for a linear equation)
**Induced Consumption**: consumption that is determined by the level of income (and the slope of the line
**Autonomous Expenditure**: expenditure that does not depend on the level of GDP.
**Induced Expenditure**: expenditure that depends on the level of GDP
*The Multiplier Effect*
**Multiplier**: the increase in equilibrium real GDP divided by the increase in autonomous expenditure and a **Multiplier Effect**: the process by which an increase in autonomous expenditure leads to a larger increase in real GDP.
Multiplier = (Change in equilibrium real GDP) / (Change in autonomous expenditure)
Multiplier = 1/(1-MPC)

**Summarising the Multiplier Effect**
1. the multiplier effect occurs when autonomous expenditure increases *or* decreases
2. the multiplier effect makes the economy more sensitive to changes in autonomous expenditure than it would otherwise be
3. the larger the MPC, the larger the value of the multiplier
4. The formula for the multiplier we are using here is *over-simplified* because it ignores the effect that an increasing GDP can have on imports, inflation and interest rates.

**If you get confused about this, read the intuition behind the multiplier effect from this lecture video slide thingy**

**Paradox of Thrift**: simultaneously increase saving and reduce spending in many households, aggregate expenditure may fall, leading to a contraction or recession. Lower incomes during a recession may mean that total saving does not increase.

**Focus on Changes in the Price Level**
An inverse relationship exists between changes in the price level and changes in aggregrate expenditure:
- Increases in the price level decrease consumption by decreasing real wealth, causing aggregate expenditure to fall; a falling price has the reverse result
- a price rise in Australia relative to price rises in other countries will cause net exports to fall, causing aggregate expenditure to fall; a falling price has the reverse result
- if prices rise and the central bank (RBA) does not increase the availability of funds (using 'accomodative policy'), interest rates will rise, reducing investment spending.

## W8 - The AS/AD Model
### L1

The **Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply model** trise to explain short-run fluctuations in real GDP and the price level.
Real GDP and the price levl are determined in the short run by the intersection of the short-run AD curve and the short-run AS curves.
**AD Curve**: shows the relationship between the price level (or inflation rate as an alternative but equivalent sepicfication) and the quantity of real GDP demanded by hosueholds firms and hte government, i.e. the whole economy
**AS Curve**: A curve that shows the relationship in the short run between the price level and the quantity of real GDP supplied.

An AD curve is built up from the demand side of the economy - C+I+G+NX. Shows total AD (or AE) assoviated with different inflation rates.
iA market demand curve is, by contrast, the sum of willingness-to-pay for a pgiven good at various prices acros all potential buyer of that good. 

AD slope goes dowwnwards because of wealth effect, interest rate effect, and international trade effect

Variables that shift the AD curve:
- changes in government policies
- changes in expectations of households and firms
- changes in foreign variables in outside economies

**Long-run AS curve**: a curve thatt shows the relationship in hte long run between the price levle and the quantity of real GDP supplied. Shows that in the LR increases in the price level do anot affect the leevel of real GDP

### L2

**Short-run AS curve**: upward sloping shows that (in the short run) firms will produce more in response to higher prices. This is because generally the prices of inputs tend to rise more slowly that the prices of the final products. 
**Menu Costs**: costs to firms of changing prices

Three theories behind the positive relationship between inflation (or price level) and output:
1. money illusion - 'misreading' inflation as higher or lower than it actually is
2. sticky wages ("Keynesian") - wages may take more time to adjust than prices (e.g. because of contracts), and social conventions such as perceptions of fairness, which are slow to adjust
3. sticky prices ("New Keynesian") - for some goods there may be long-term contracts with purchasers or complex pricing schemes that take time to be adjusted

Changes in the price level are depicted in movements up or down a stationary short-run aggregate supply curve.

Exogenous shocks cause the SRAS curve to shift

Variables that shift *both* the SR and LR aggregate supply curves:
1. increases in the labour force and/or in the capital stock and/or in resources
2. Technological change

## L2

**Macroeconomics**: 
- Emphasis on the 'A' for the aggregate economy.
- Study of the performance of the national and global economies

**Normative Economics**: study of what ought to be
**Positive Economics**: study of what is

**Correlation**: statistical relationship between two (or more) sets of data

**Key Assumptions**: Assume that people are:
- Rational
- Maximizing (prefer more to less)
- Self-interested ( care first about themselves, only secondly about others)

**Elements of a typical model**:
- *Parameters*: inputs fixed over time
- *Variables*: inputs that change over time, two types:
1. **Endogenous**: explained by the model
2. **Exodogenous**: determined outside the model
- *Functional Relations*: rules that characterize the realtaionship between two or more endogenous variables in a model

**Fallacy Of Composition**: sum of the parts always equal to the whole, which is WRONG


## L3

**Technical Efficiency**: Macimum output for minimum input
**National Income Accounting**: Government's methodology for keeping track of measures of aggregate economic activity

**Circular Flow Model**
- Start by assuming a *close economy* (operates in a state of autarky) (*open economy*: economy which trades with other economies)

## L4

We have the actual lecturer today, amazing!

**Introduction to the Great Depression**


## L6

Be sure to get all the shit from L5 this weekend brother

Emergency Banking Act, March 6, 1933 - closed the banks under a national ‘banking holiday’ to help stabilise the crisis

## L7

**National Income and Product Accounting**

National income accounting provides a systematic method of  aggregating the production of diverse goods into a single measure of overall economic activity as traded in and/or valued by market exchanges 
Conceptually based on circular flow model
Production function also basic concept behind national income accounts
Y = f (K, L, La)  
Y (output) dependent on K (amount of capital), L (Land) and La (Labour) used
NIA conceptually measure the total economy:
- as a machine in which inputs are transformed thorough various processes to yield outputs
- a flow of output being recycled through consumption and investment spending and factor payments

**GDP**: is the market value of the final goods and services produced in an economy over a certain period

PRODUCTION = EXPENDITURE = INCOME
- Expenditure measure of GDP counts the total purchases in the economy
- Income measure of GDP counts all the income earned in the economy
- Production measure of GDP counts the number of goods produced in the economy

Y = C + I + G + NX
C (Consumption), I (Investment), G (Government), NX (Net Exports)

NX = Merchandise exports - Imports
Negative NX is a “leakage” from a domestic enomy because some economic expenditure is in effect flowing out of the country into the rest of the world

## L8

**Income Approach to GDP**: Measures sum of all income earned in the economy
**Production Approach to GDP**: 
- Amount each producer contributes to GDP is called *value added*
- Value add = revenue gen. by each producer - value of intermediate products
- *Primary producer + Intermediate producer = final producer*

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: total value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a one-year period (produced within borders)
**Gross National Product (GNP)**: aggregate final outpt of citizens and businesses of an economy in one year. GNP = GDP + net foreign factor income
**Net Foreign Factor Income**: income from foreign domestic factor sources minus foreign factor income earned domestically

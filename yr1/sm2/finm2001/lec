## L1

4 Types of Firms:
- Sole proprietor (private: one owner)
- Partnerships (private: between 2 and 20 owners)
- Limited liability companies (private: many owners)
- Corporations (public: many, many owners)

**Main characteristics of a corporation**
- Legal entity, separate from it's owners, hence, limitied liability
- Separation of ownership and management

**Agency Conflict**
- The separation of onwrship and control pgives rise  to what is known as the *agency conflict*
- The agent (manager) may not act in the best interests of the principal (owner)
- How might the owner of the firm reduce the principal-agent conflict? The most common way is to link manager compensation to company performance

**Objective of a firm**: maximize shareholder's wealt
Firms exist to create value *over and above* that which it's owners can create by themselves. Moreover, firms that do not create this value will be either:
- Forced to undergo change; or
- Cease to exist altogether

## L1

4 Types of Firms:
- Sole proprietor (private: one owner)
- Partnerships (private: between 2 and 20 owners)
- Limited liability companies (private: many owners)
- Corporations (public: many, many owners)

**Main characteristics of a corporation**
- Legal entity, separate from it's owners, hence, limitied liability
- Separation of ownership and management

**Agency Conflict**
- The separation of onwrship and control pgives rise  to what is known as the *agency conflict*
- The agent (manager) may not act in the best interests of the principal (owner)
- How might the owner of the firm reduce the principal-agent conflict? The most common way is to link manager compensation to company performance

**Objective of a firm**: maximize shareholder's wealt
Firms exist to create value *over and above* that which it's owners can create by themselves. Moreover, firms that do not create this value will be either:
- Forced to undergo change; or
- Cease to exist altogether

Required Rate of Return = real risk-free rate + expected inflation + risk premiums


## L2

**Investment Decisions (NPV, IRR and more!) **
Chapter 7 for reading (when you get the book you fucking slug)

QUIZ NEXT WEEK
Workshop this week too, got some questions to do for that niqqa

**Depreciation**: calculated 3 ways:
1. straight line
2. reducing-balance
3. accelerated depreciation

**Accelerated**: follows a depreciation schedule set by the tax authorities that is based on the type of asset being depreciated

**Working Capital**: shit to work with on hand at the time. Increase treated as cash outflow

*Remember*: indifferent if NPV=0

Unless told otherwise, assume the NWC is fully recovered unless otherwise stated

4 Methods of Project Evaluation:
- Net Present Value (NPV)
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Payback Period (PP)
- Average Accounting Return (AAR)

**IRR**: discount rate that causes a project's NPV to equal 0
k = rrr
if IRR > k, accept
if IRR < k, reject
if IRR = k, indiff

When doing manually, have to do trial and error. Pick something reasonable, like 3% or 8%.
Higher IRR - probs more negative, means too higher, use a lower IRR

When IRR Rule does not apply:
- Delayed investments
- nonexistent IRR
- multiple IRR


## W1

Reminder that we have a quiz next tutorial, not fun, on the stuff from this weekend so get ready to do that shit you nerd. Also donâ€™t forget you have your maths assignment to do too.

**Incremental IRR**
IRR of the incremental cash flows that would result from replacing one project with the other

**Shortcomings**:
- may not exist
- multiple may exist
- the other ones that apply to the normal IRR still apply to this one as well
- NPV still much better to use if possible

## L3

**Capital Budgeting**

**Methods of comparing projects with different lives**:
- Equivalent annual value method
- Constant chain o replacement in perpetuity method
- lowest common multiple method

((EAV Formula already in my book!!!!!!!! Extra practise available )

in the extra shit folder on wattle so make sure to do that

**Project Selection with Resource Constraints**
- May not actually be able to accept all NPV positive projects available
- Can be assessed using a Profitability Index
- Firm has to select the best combination of available projects given the resources available

Profitability Index assumes that:
1. The set of project taken will exhaust all resources completely
2. There is only a single relevant resource constraint that can be considered by the index at any one time

**Incremental Earnings**: Sales - COGS - General Expenses - R&D - DEP = EBIT (earnings before Interest and Tax)
EBIT - Income Tax = Unlevered Net Income

Rent is usually pre-paid

**Cannibalization**: when sales of a new product displace sales of an existing product
This and cost of rent *should* be included in the decision making process

**Sunk Costs**: costs that have been or will be paid regardless of the decision whether or not the investment is undertaken. *Not to be included in the decision making*

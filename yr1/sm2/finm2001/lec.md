## L1

4 Types of Firms:
- Sole proprietor (private: one owner)
- Partnerships (private: between 2 and 20 owners)
- Limited liability companies (private: many owners)
- Corporations (public: many, many owners)

**Main characteristics of a corporation**
- Legal entity, separate from it's owners, hence, limitied liability
- Separation of ownership and management

**Agency Conflict**
- The separation of onwrship and control pgives rise  to what is known as the *agency conflict*
- The agent (manager) may not act in the best interests of the principal (owner)
- How might the owner of the firm reduce the principal-agent conflict? The most common way is to link manager compensation to company performance

**Objective of a firm**: maximize shareholder's wealt
Firms exist to create value *over and above* that which it's owners can create by themselves. Moreover, firms that do not create this value will be either:
- Forced to undergo change; or
- Cease to exist altogether

Required Rate of Return = real risk-free rate + expected inflation + risk premiums


## L2

**Investment Decisions (NPV, IRR and more!) **
Chapter 7 for reading (when you get the book you fucking slug)

QUIZ NEXT WEEK
Workshop this week too, got some questions to do for that niqqa

**Depreciation**: calculated 3 ways:
1. straight line
2. reducing-balance
3. accelerated depreciation

**Accelerated**: follows a depreciation schedule set by the tax authorities that is based on the type of asset being depreciated

**Working Capital**: shit to work with on hand at the time. Increase treated as cash outflow

*Remember*: indifferent if NPV=0

Unless told otherwise, assume the NWC is fully recovered unless otherwise stated

4 Methods of Project Evaluation:
- Net Present Value (NPV)
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Payback Period (PP)
- Average Accounting Return (AAR)

**IRR**: discount rate that causes a project's NPV to equal 0
k = rrr
if IRR > k, accept
if IRR <\\> k, reject
if IRR = k, indiff

When doing manually, have to do trial and error. Pick something reasonable, like 3% or 8%.
Higher IRR - probs more negative, means too higher, use a lower IRR

When IRR Rule does not apply:
- Delayed investments
- nonexistent IRR
- multiple IRR


## W1

Reminder that we have a quiz next tutorial, not fun, on the stuff from this weekend so get ready to do that shit you nerd. Also donâ€™t forget you have your maths assignment to do too.

**Incremental IRR**
IRR of the incremental cash flows that would result from replacing one project with the other

**Shortcomings**:
- may not exist
- multiple may exist
- the other ones that apply to the normal IRR still apply to this one as well
- NPV still much better to use if possible
- mulitple may exist


## L3

**Capital Budgeting**

**Methods of comparing projects with different lives**:
- Equivalent annual value method
- Constant chain o replacement in perpetuity method
- lowest common multiple method

((EAV Formula already in my book!!!!!!!! Extra practise available )

in the extra shit folder on wattle so make sure to do that

**Project Selection with Resource Constraints**
- May not actually be able to accept all NPV positive projects available
- Can be assessed using a Profitability Index
- Firm has to select the best combination of available projects given the resources available

Profitability Index assumes that:
1. The set of project taken will exhaust all resources completely
2. There is only a single relevant resource constraint that can be considered by the index at any one time

**Incremental Earnings**: Sales - COGS - General Expenses - R&D - DEP = EBIT (earnings before Interest and Tax)
EBIT - Income Tax = Unlevered Net Income

Rent is usually pre-paid

**Cannibalization**: when sales of a new product displace sales of an existing product
This and cost of rent *should* be included in the decision making process

**Sunk Costs**: costs that have been or will be paid regardless of the decision whether or not the investment is undertaken. *Not to be included in the decision making*


## L4

**Leasing**

Chapter 25 in buku

**Lease**: contract between twow parties, the Lessee and the Lessor. Lessee: party lble for periodic payments in exchange for the right to use the asset. Lessor: entitled to the lease payments in exchange for lending the asset
a
- Involve little or no upfront payment
- At the end of the contract term, the lease specifies who will retain ownership of the asset and at what terms. Typically, the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a predetermined value or the market price
- Also specifies cancellation provisions, possibility of extensions, responsibility for maintenance, etc.

**Types of Leases**
*Sales-type Lease*: A type of lease in which the lessor is the manufacturer of the asset (e.g. photocopier from Xerox)
*Direct Lease*: Lessor is not the manufacturer, often an independent company that specializes in purchasing assets and leasing them to customers
*Sales and Lease-back*: Describes a type of lease in which a firm already owns an asset it would prefer to lease. Firm sells asset, gets cash, leases back from the new owner and makes lease payments. Useful for firms facing a funding shortfall or firms that are asset rich but cash poor.
*Leveraged Lease*: Lessor borrows from a bank or other lender to obtain the initial capital to purchase an asset, using the lease payments to pay back the bank loan.

In order to value a lease, we need to consider the residual value of the asset. Residual value is the asset's market value at the end of the lease

**Lease payments are made at the beginning of each period, i.e. payment starts at time 0, *annuity due***

**PV(Lease Payments) = Purchase Price - PV(Residual Value)**

*Fair Market Value Lease*: Gives the lessee the option to purchase the asset at it's fair market value at the termination of the lease
*$1 Out Lease (Or Finance Lease)*: Get the asset at nominal cost of $1. Basically purchasing over time
*Fixed Price Lease*: Lessee has the option to purchase the asset at the end of the lease for a fixed price that is set upfront in the lease contract (this is a long call!). Lease payments oft. higher to compensate for this option.
*Fair Market Value Cap*: lessee can purcase the asset at the minimum of its fair market value and a fixed price or 'cap'
*Operating Lease*: Lease in which the lessor receives the depreciation deduction associated with the ownership of the asset
*Finance Lease*: Lessee receives the depreciation deductions for tax purposes and can also deduct the interest portion of the lease payments as an interest expense


When calculating incremental cash flows, use Lease - Buy

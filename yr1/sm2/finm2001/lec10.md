**Payout Policy (Dividends and Signalling)**

Companies can use dividends to signal the future prospects of the firm

If a firm has already taken all positive-NPV projects, any additional projects it takes on are zero or negative-NPV projects.
  * Rather than waste excess cash on -ve NPV projects, a firm can retain the cash or use the cash to purchase fiancial assets

With market imperfections, there is a tradeoff to saving cash: retaining cash can reduce the costs of raising capital in the future, ***but*** it can also increase taxes
Corporate taxes make it costly for firms to retain excess cash
  * Cash is equivalent to negative leverage, so the tax advantage of leverage implies a tax disadvantage to holding cash

Despite tax disadvantages of hoarding cash on the balance sheet, firms retain cash balances to cover potential future cash shortfalls
  * If there is a reasonable chance that future earnings will be insufficient to fund future +ve NPV investment opportunities

When firms have excessive cash reserves, managers may use the funds inefficiently by paying excessive executive perks, over-paying for acquisitions, empire building, etc
Firms should choose to retain as much cash as it needs to help future growth opportunities and to avoid financial distress costs. Beyond that, cash should be paid out to shareholders.

Costs of holding cash:
- Taxes
- Agency (wasteful behaviour)

Benefits:
- Avoid financial distress
- Avoid accessing external capital markets in the future (costly)

**Dividend Smoothing**: The practice of maintaining relatively constant dividends

The last market imperfection of interest is **assymetric information**, where managers know more about the firm than the shareholders

**Dividend Signalling Hypothesis**: the idea that dividend changes reflect managers' views about a firm's future earning prospects
  - The firm's dividend choice will contain information regarding managements's expectations of future earnings if the firm smooths dividends.
  - If management increases dividends this period, they are signaling that the dividend will remain at the higher level in the future (vice versa)

A dividend increase may also signal a lack of investment opportunities
Conversely, a firm might cut its dividend to exploit new +ve NPV projects

Share repurchases can also be used as a signal of firm value and future prospects. This is a credible signal that the shares are underpriced, because if they are overpriced a share repurchase is costly to the firm

**Stock Dividends and Splits**: an alternative to cash dividends. With a stock dividend, a firm does not pay out any cash to shareholders. As a result, the total market value of the firm's equity is unchanged. Only thing that's different is the number of shares outstanding. Stock price falls because same equity over larger number of shares. Stock dividends of 50% and above are referred to as stock splits.
Typical motivation for a stock split is to keep the share price in a range thought to be attractive to small investors. If the share price rises "too high", becomes difficult for small investors to invest in the stock since suck investors often invest in the stock since suck investors often invest in lots of 100 shares.

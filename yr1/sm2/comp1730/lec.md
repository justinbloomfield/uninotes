"If it was hard to write, it's probably hard to read. Add a comment"

**Abstraction**: To use a function, we only need to know *what* it does, not *how*

**Function suite**: sequence of statements within a function

**Variables, expressions and more functions**

"\" works to continue a line on to the next one

Expressions are built up of:
- literals
- variables
- operators
- function calls

Value types:
- integers
- floating points

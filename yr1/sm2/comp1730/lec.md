# COMP1730

Lecturer: Patrik Haslum 


## L1
NO FRIDAY LECTURE this week
Log in to STREAMS at cs.anu.edu.au/streams, 

**Assessments**:
- 3 lab assignments, 30%, best 2
- 1 homework assignmen, 20%
- Mid term, 20%
- Final exam, 30%

## L2

**Procedural abstraction, with robots**

Not much is happening lol. Lecturer runs Mint :(((((((((( i think he does at least, we can hope that he doesn't, because that would make me a sad boy

"If it was hard to write, it's probably hard to read. Add a comment"

**Abstraction**: To use a function, we only need to know *what* it does, not *how*

**Function suite**: sequence of statements within a function



## L3

**Variables, expressions and more functions**

"\" works to continue a line on to the next one

Expressions are built up of:
- literals
- variables
- operators
- function calls

**Values and Types**

Value types:
- integers
- floating points
- strings
- booleans
- ...and others that come later

Operators in Python:
+,-,*,/ - std

\*\* - power
// - floor
% - remainder

**Function**: a piece of the program that is given a name, and can be called by that name (think i already wrote that but yolo)

**Variables**

## L6

**while** statement

## L7

**Floating point numbers**

We do have a lecture tomorrow! Stuff about the assignment we have next week
**Sequential encoding system**: represents each item by a sequence of symbols; the order ofa symbol in the thing *is* important
Remember that binary is a *base 2* system

**FP Representation**: x = ±m x b^e
consists of three components:
- the sign (+ or -)
- the significand (m)
- the exponent (e)
Number is *normalised* if 1≤m</b\>
Zero not representable as a normalised number
Floats can represent infinity (1/ 1e-320)
When adding FP, the absolute rounding erros is porportional tothe magnitude of the largetst number that is rounded


## L8

Course Reps on wattle page
Need to bring student ID to assignment next week
Make sure to name the functions as they are described, otherwise the testing program won't find them and then you'll be shitted

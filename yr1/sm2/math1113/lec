Enrolment opens this Thursday at 2pm
Lecturers:Vigleik Angeltveit, Bryan Wang
Taught by two niggaz
Bryan doing most of the lectures before the midsem break, Vigleik most of them after
Be sure to check WATTLE
Book necessary i think??? Not sure, sure he'll mention it later
Book is in course outline (obvs) so check that as well
No calculator in exams (ripripripriprip)

**Functions**
Ch. 2 in lecture notes
A **function** is a rule that assigns to x e A an element f(x) e B
The domain of f(x) B is: D(f) = { x | f(x) B defined}
The range of f(x) B is: R(f) = {y | y=f(x), sane x}
Ex : The domain of sinx is R = (-∞, ∞)
The range is [-1,1]
Define Sinx by Sinx = sinx for x e [-π/2, π/2]
Then D(Sinx) = [-π/2,π/2]
Regard sinx and Sinx as different functions

If R(g) ≤ D(F) the *composite* fºg (o is a circle thingy)
is defined as
fºg(x) = f(g(x))
Ex: f(x)=√(x), g(x) = e^x - 1. Then
    R(g)=(-1,∞) ≤/≤ D(f) = [0, ∞)
    So fºg B is not defined
If we restrict the domain of g to [0, ∞), then R(g) = [0, ∞) and we can compose
fºg(x) = √(e^x - 1), D(fºg) = [0, ∞)
Usually restriction of D(g) goes without saying

**Limits** 
Ch. 3 in lecture notes
If f(x) is defined for all x near a, excepts possibly at a, and we can guarantee that f(x) B is as close to L as we want by requiring that x B is sufficiently close but not equal to a then the lim<sub>x->a</sub>f(x)=L
*Note*: We only care f(x), for close to a, not about f(a)
Ex: f(x)=x^2, a=2
    To gaurantee that f(x) B within 0.001 of 4, we can require that x B is within 0.0001 of 2.
    1.9999^2 = 3.99960001
    2.0001^2 = 4.00040001
To prove that lim<sub>x->2</sub> f(x) = 4, we need to show that given e>0 there is a ∂ > 0 such that if |x-2|<∂ (and x ≠ 2), then |f(x)-4|<e
Ex: f(x) = (1+(1/x^2))^(1/x^2)
Then f(0) is not defined
Claim that lim<sub>x->0</sub>f(x) = e = 2.718281828459045
